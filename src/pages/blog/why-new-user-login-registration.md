## Approaches to solving Identity

Before going ahead let's look at the "Identity Landscape" of today. The disclaimer is probably obvious, but please take
our findings and arguments as an opinion. We do have lots of experience in this space, but every system has its use case
and place. We do want to bash other systems to gain competitive advantage, but it is important to understand what technology
to use and what drawbacks (and upsides) you get.

For a full comparison with other open and closed source systems, head over to the
[Comparison Chapter](../further-reading/comparison.md).
