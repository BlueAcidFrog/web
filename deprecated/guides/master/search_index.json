Developer Guide","keywords":"","body":"ORY Developer Guide\nWelcome to the ORY Developer Guide!\n\n\n\nThe ORY Ecosystem\nExamples\n\n\n\n\nWe provide an open source ecosystem of services with clear boundaries that solve authentication and authorization:\n\nORY Hydra is an OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect provider.\nORY Oathkeeper is an Identity and Access Proxy.\nORY Keto is an access control server.\nTBA is an identity management server.\n\nEach service works standalone but you can also combine them to get the full feature set. If you've never heard of an Identity & Access Proxy\nbefore, or you want to learn more about the individual services and how they play together, stick with us through the\nnext sections.\nThe ORY Ecosystem\nAlmost every application has the concept of users and permissions. An anonymous user, for example, is allowed to\nread blog posts while certain authenticated users are allowed to write blog posts. While this is the basis for most\napplications out there, access control becomes increasingly complex as an application grows. What started out with\na user's username and password now shifted to machine-2-machine interaction, third party developers accessing your\nuser's data, and maybe even a micro service system architecture.\nOur products solve the simplest use case and give you the ability to instantly ready the system for more complex scenarios without\npainful and slow upgrade processes.\nThe first service, which is to be announced soon, focuses on identity management. Instead of re-writing login, logout,\nactivation emails, 2fa, and worring about GDPR, you spin up a docker image and write a simple UI for it in the language\nor framework of your choice.\nORY Hydra enables you to become an OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect provider. If you're not writing a basic web app but something\nthat has to work on different devices, that has machine-2-machine interaction, or enables third-party developers to use\nyour API (and pay for it), then this is what you're looking for. ORY Hydra is not identity management, though. Instead,\nit connects to your existing identity management (e.g. the one from the paragraph above, or your MySQL+PHP login service,\nor your Federated SAML SSO) and is capable of issuing, in a secure and OpenID Certified manner, access, refresh, and ID tokens.\nOf course, it's shipped as a 5MB Docker Image with almost no configuration required.\nNow that your users access your application through, for example, a React/Angular app and a REST api, you need a way\nto authenticate the user and to check if he/she has the necessary permissions (we call this \"access control\" from now on).\nOne way would be, of course, to add these checks in your code. Another is to deploy the 5MB ORY Oathkeeper Docker Image,\ndefine access rules for your API endpoints (e.g. OAuth 2.0 Access Token + certain set of permissions, a valid JSON Web Token,\na valid SAML assertion, ...) and put it - like a firewall - in front of your services.\nYou might start out with a simple permission system. You've got different roles: anonymous users (not logged in),\nauthenticated users (logged in), and administrators. At some point however, the system gets more complex. You want\nto distinct permissions based on the user's organization, the access time (think time lock in banking), or the billing\nplan he/she's on. Big cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services or Google solve this using \"Access Control Policies\".\nThese policies represent flexible rules and allow you to express complex access control scenarios. You could, of course,\nwrite your own system or spend a bit of time educating yourself about RBAC, ACL, ABAC, ACP - or (you probably already guessed it) -\nboot up the 5MB ORY Keto Docker Image. ORY Keto is able to authenticate different types of credentials (e.g. OAuth 2.0 Access\nTokens, SAML Assertions, JSON Web Tokens, ...) and allows you to define advanced permission rules (\"Access Control Policies\").\nAnd there's of course an endpoint that tells you if a certain set of credentials (e.g. an OAuth 2.0 Access Token) is allowed\nto modify that blog post.\n\nIf you were to use the full ORY Ecosystem, it would probably look something like this. Keep in mind that any component\nshown here can be replaced or removed, depending on your use case.\nNow you know what this ecosystem has to offer you. To get some more information on the services, read the developer guide by\nselecting the software of your choice from the navigation on the left!\nContact us at hi@ory.sh if you need consulting with your specific project.\nExamples\nThe ory/examples repository contains numerous examples of setting up these services\nindividually, and together. Check them out to get a real-world view of this ecosystem!\n"},"updating/":{"url":"updating/","title":"Performing Software Updates","keywords":"","body":"Performing Software Updates\nGood software improves over time.

This documentation will\n\nteach you what OAuth2 and OpenID Connect are and how ORY Hydra fits in the picture.\nhelp you run a ORY Hydra installation on your system using Docker.\nteach you how to install, configure, run and use ORY Hydra.\n\nLet us begin with the first part, understanding what OAuth2 and OpenID Connect are.\nWhat is ORY Hydra?\nORY Hydra is an OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect Provider. As such, it is capable of issuing access, refresh, and ID Tokens.\nContrary to other projects out there, ORY Hydra does not offer user management (login, logout, profile management,\nregistration) but instead uses a redirection-based flow and a REST API to delegate user authentication (login) to\na service which you implement and control. This allows you to build a user management that works for you, with the frontend\ntechnology that you like, and authentication mechanisms required by your use case (e.g. token-based 2FA, SMS 2FA).\nAs such, ORY Hydra is the most flexible OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect provider out there and gives you great freedom\nin implementing your business logic, and still getting all the benefits from OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect.\nAdditional to the OAuth 2.0 functionality, ORY Hydra offers a safe storage for cryptographic keys (e.g. for signing JSON Web Tokens)\nand is capable of managing OAuth 2.0 Clients.\nORY Hydra is OpenID Connect certified (pending) and implements all the requirements stated by the OpenID Foundation. As such,\nit correctly implements the different OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect flows as intended by the IETF and OpenID Foundation.\nIntroduction to OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect\nThis section will give you some ideas of what OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect 1.0 are for. If you\nalready know what OAuth2 and OpenID Connect are and how they work, you can skip to the next Section.\nThis section will not explain how the various flows of OAuth2 work and how they look like. We strongly recommend\nto read the following articles:\n\nDigitalOcean: An Introduction to OAuth 2\nAaron Parecki: OAuth2 Simplified\nZapier: Chapter 5: Authentication, Part 2\n\nPlease be aware that we do not aim to explain OAuth 2.0 in great detail. We assume that you have some knowledge\nof the flows and strongly encourage you to refresh your knowledge with the articles listed above.\nWhat is OAuth 2.0?\nThe OAuth 2.0 authorization framework is a memo in the\nRequest for Comments document series published by the\nIETF Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). Memos in the Requests for Comments (RFC) document series\ncontain technical and organizational notes about the Internet. They cover many aspects of computer\nnetworking, including protocols, procedures, programs, and concepts [...].\nThe OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables a third-party\napplication to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on\nbehalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction\nbetween the resource owner and the HTTP service, or by allowing the\nthird-party application to obtain access on its own behalf.\nIn the traditional client-server authentication model, the client\nrequests an access-restricted resource (protected resource) on the\nserver by authenticating with the server using the resource owner's\ncredentials. In order to provide third-party applications access to\nrestricted resources, the resource owner shares its credentials with\nthe third party. This creates several problems and limitations.\nOAuth addresses these issues by introducing an authorization layer\nand separating the role of the client from that of the resource\nowner.  In OAuth, the client requests access to resources controlled\nby the resource owner and hosted by the resource server, and is\nissued a different set of credentials than those of the resource\nowner.\nInstead of using the resource owner's credentials to access protected\nresources, the client obtains an access token -- a string denoting a\nspecific scope, lifetime, and other access attributes.  Access tokens\nare issued to third-party clients by an authorization server with the\napproval of the resource owner.  The client uses the access token to\naccess the protected resources hosted by the resource server.\nSource: IETF RFC 6749\nOAuth 2.0 Example\nAn end-user (resource owner) can grant a printing\nservice (client) access to her protected photos stored at a photo-\nsharing service (resource server), without sharing her username and\npassword with the printing service.  Instead, she authenticates\ndirectly with a server trusted by the photo-sharing service\n(authorization server), which issues the printing service delegation-\nspecific credentials (access token).\nSource: IETF RFC 6749\nWhat is OpenID Connect 1.0?\nOpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol.\nIt enables Clients to verify the identity of the End-User based on the authentication performed\nby an Authorization Server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-User in\nan interoperable and REST-like manner.\nAs background, the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework and OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token\nUsage specifications provide a general framework for third-party\napplications to obtain and use limited access to HTTP resources.\nThey define mechanisms to obtain and use Access Tokens to access resources\nbut do not define standard methods to provide identity information.\nNotably, without profiling OAuth 2.0, it is incapable of providing information\nabout the authentication of an End-User.\nOpenID Connect implements authentication as an extension to the OAuth 2.0 authorization process.\nSource OpenID Connect Core 1.0\nOpenID Connect allows clients of all types, including Web-based, mobile, and JavaScript clients,\nto request and receive information about authenticated sessions and end-users. The specification\nsuite is extensible, allowing participants to use optional features such as encryption of identity data,\ndiscovery of OpenID Providers, and session management, when it makes sense for them.\nThere are different work flows for OpenID Connect 1.0, we recommend checking out the OpenID Connect sandbox at\nopenidconnect.net.\nIntroduction to Hydra\nHydra is a server implementation of the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework and the OpenID Connect Core 1.0. Existing OAuth2\nimplementations usually ship as libraries or SDKs such as node-oauth2-server\nor fosite, or as fully featured identity solutions with user\nmanagement and user interfaces, such as Keycloak or Okta.\nImplementing and using OAuth2 without understanding the whole specification is challenging and prone to errors, even when\nSDKs are being used. The primary goal of Hydra is to make OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect 1.0 less painful to set up and easier to use.\nHydra implements the flows described in OAuth2 and OpenID Connect 1.0 without forcing you to use a \"Hydra User Management\"\nor some template engine or a predefined front-end. Instead it relies on HTTP redirection and cryptographic methods\nto verify user consent allowing you to use Hydra with any authentication endpoint, be it authboss,\nauth0.com or your proprietary PHP authentication.\nHydra incorporates best practices in the area of the web service technology:\n\nHydra ships as a single binary for all popular platforms including Linux, OSX and Windows, without any additional\ndependencies. For further simplicity, Hydra is available as a Docker Image.\nHydra is built security first: architecture and work flows are designed to neutralize various common (OWASP TOP TEN)\nand uncommon attack vectors. Learn more.\nHydra has a low CPU and memory footprint, short start up times and a CLI with developers in mind.\nHydra scales effortlessly up and down on every platform imaginable, including Heroku, Cloud Foundry, Docker,\nGoogle Container Engine and many more.\n\nHydra has a limitations too:\n\nHydra is not something that manages user accounts. Hydra does not offer user registration, password reset, user\nlogin, sending confirmation emails. This is what the Identity Provider is responsible for.\nThe communication between Hydra and the Identity Provider is called Login and Consent Flow.\nIf you are building a simple service for 50-100 registered users, OAuth2 and Hydra will probably be too sophisticated.\nHydra will not support the OAuth2 resource owner password credentials flow. This flow is legacy, discouraged,\nand insecure.\n\nOAuth2 is used in many areas, for various purposes and supported by all well known programming languages, but it is important\nto understand what the vision of OAuth2 is. This non-exclusive list might help you decide, if OAuth 2.0 and Hydra are\nthe right fit for you.\n\nIf you want to allow third-party developers accessing your APIs now or in the future, Hydra is the perfect fit. This is what an OAuth2 Provider does.\nIf you want to become a Identity Provider, like Google, Facebook or Microsoft, OpenID Connect and thus Hydra is a perfect fit.\nRunning an OAuth2 Provider works great with browser, mobile and wearable apps, as you can avoid storing access\ncredentials on the device, phone or wearable and revoke access tokens, and thus access privileges, at any time.\nIf you have a lot of services and want to limit automated access (think: cronjobs) for those services,\nOAuth2 might make sense for you. Example: The comment service is not allowed to read user passwords when fetching\nthe latest user profile updates.\n\nOAuth 2.0 Case Study\nOAuth2 and OpenID Connect are tricky to understand. It is important to understand that OAuth2 is\na delegation protocol. It makes sense to use Hydra in new and existing projects. A use case covering an existing project\nexplains how one would use Hydra in a new one as well. So let's look at a use case!\nLet's assume we are running a ToDo List App (todo24.com). ToDo24 has a login endpoint (todo24.com/login).\nThe login endpoint is written in node and uses MongoDB to store user information (email + password + settings). Of course,\ntodo24 has other services as well: list management (todo24.com/lists/manage: close, create, move),\nitem management (todo24.com/lists/items/manage: mark solved, add), and so on. You are using cookie-based sessions to see which\nuser is performing the request.\nNow you decide to use OAuth2 on top of your current infrastructure. There are many reasons to do this:\n\nYou want to open your APIs to third-party developers. Their apps will be using OAuth2 Access Tokens to access a user's to do list.\nYou want more client applications, for example browser app (SPA), mobile app, car, ...\nYou have Cross Origin Requests. Making cookies work with Cross Origin Requests weakens or even disables important anti-CSRF measures.\n\nThese are only a couple of reasons to use OAuth2. You might decide to use OAuth2 as your single source of authorization, thus maintaining\nonly one authorization protocol and being able to open up to third party devs in no time. With OpenID Connect, you are able to delegate authentication as well as authorization!\nYour decision is final. You want to use OAuth2 and you want Hydra to do the job. You install Hydra in your cluster using docker.\nNext, you set up some exemplary OAuth2 clients. Clients can act on their own, but most of the time they need to access a user's todo lists.\nTo do so, the client initiates an OAuth2 request. This is where the user login & consent flow comes into play.\nBefore Hydra can issue an access token, we need to know WHICH user is giving consent. To do so, Hydra redirects the user agent (e.g. browser, mobile device)\nto the login endpoint alongside with a challenge that contains important request information. The login endpoint (todo24.com/login) authenticates the\nuser as usual, e.g. by username & password, session cookie or other means. Upon successful authentication, the login endpoint\nredirects the user back to ORY Hydra. Next, ORY Hydra needs the user's consent for which the user agent is redirected to the consent endpoint (todo24.com/consent)\nwhere the user is asked for consent: \"Do you want to grant MyCoolAnalyticsApp read & write access to all your todo lists? [Yes] [No]\". Once the user clicks Yes and gives consent,\nthe consent endpoint redirects back to ORY Hydra which then validates the request and finally issues the access, refresh, and ID tokens.\nYou can validate the access tokens which are sent to your API directly at ORY Hydra, or use an Identity & Access Proxy\nlike ORY Oathkeeper to do it for you.\n"},"hydra/1-tutorial/":{"url":"hydra/1-tutorial/","title":"5 Minute Tutorial","keywords":"","body":"5 Minute Tutorial\nTo get started quickly, we provide a Docker Compose based example for setting up ORY Hydra, a PostgreSQL instance\nand an exemplary user login & consent app. You need to have the latest Docker as well as Docker Compose version installed.\n\nNext, clone (git clone https://github.com/ory/hydra.git), download,\nor use go get -d github.com/ory/hydra - if you have Go (1.10+) installed on you system - to download the Docker Compose\nset up.\n$ git clone https://github.com/ory/hydra.git\n$ cd hydra\n$ git checkout tags/v1.0.0-beta.8\n\n$ docker-compose -p hydra up --build\nStarting hydra_mysqld_1\nStarting hydra_postgresd_1\nStarting hydra_hydra_1\n\n[...]\nEverything should running now!

You can obviously install the ORY Hydra CLI locally and avoid using\nDocker here. If you do use the CLI locally, you can omit docker exec -it hydra_hydra_1 \\ completely.\nYou will notice that two ports are being used. Port 4444 and port 4445.

The Docker Image is 5 MB light\nand versioned with verbose upgrade instructions\nand detailed changelogs. Auto-scaling, migrations, health checks,\nit all works with zero additional work required. It is possible to run ORY Hydra on any platform, including but not limited\nto OSX, Linux, Windows, ARM, FreeBSD and more.\nORY Hydra has two operational modes:\n\nIn-memory: This mode does not work with more than one instance (\"cluster\") and any state is lost after restarting the instance.\nSQL: This mode works with more than one instance and state is not lost after restarts.\n\nNo further dependencies are required for a production-ready instance.\nSQL\nThe SQL adapter supports two DBMS: PostgreSQL 9.6+ and MySQL 5.7+. Please note that\nolder MySQL versions have issues with ORY Hydra's database schema. For more information go here.\nIf you do run the SQL adapter, you must first create the database schema. The hydra serve command does not do this\nautomatically, instead you must run hydra migrate sql to create the schemas. The hydra migrate sql command\nalso runs database migrations in case of an upgrade. Please follow the upgrade instructions\nto see when you need to run this command. Always create a backup before running hydra migrate sql!\nRunning SQL migrations in Docker is very easy, check out the docker-compose\nexample to see how we did it!\nConfiguration\nBoth MySQL and PostgreSQL adapters support the following settings. You can modify these settings by appending query parameters to your DSN (postgres://user:pw@host:port/database?setting1=foo&setting2=bar):\n\nmax_conns sets the maximum number of open connections to the database. Defaults to the number of CPUs. Example postgres://user:pw@host:port/database?max_conns=10.\nmax_idle_conns sets the maximum number of connections in the idle connection pool. Defaults to the number of CPUs. Example postgres://user:pw@host:port/database?max_idle_conns=5.\nmax_conn_lifetime sets the maximum amount of time (ms, s, m, h) a connection may be reused. Defaults to 0. Example postgres://user:pw@host:port/database?max_conn_lifetime=10s.\n\nMySQL\nOn top of the settings above, MySQL supports additional settings:\n\nsql_notes, if set to false, ignores MySQL notices. If left empty or set to true, they will be treated as warnings. Example mysql://user:pw@host:port/database?sql_notes=false.\nsql_mode sets the server-side strict mode. Read more about possible values here.\n\nPostgreSQL\nOn top of the settings above, PostgreSQL supports additional settings:\n\nsslmode sets whether or not to use SSL (default is require, this is not the default for libpq). Valid values for sslmode are:\ndisable - No SSL\nrequire - Always SSL (skip verification)\nverify-ca - Always SSL (verify that the certificate presented by the\nserver was signed by a trusted CA)\nverify-full - Always SSL (verify that the certification presented by\nthe server was signed by a trusted CA and the server host name\nmatches the one in the certificate)\n\n\nfallback_application_name - An application_name to fall back to if one isn't provided.\nconnect_timeout - Maximum wait for connection, in seconds.

The\nnext sections will give you an overview of this chapter and explain some concepts. Do not skip the chapters. Seriously! :)\nThe first important concept to understand is that ORY Hydra is an OAuth 2.0 Authorization and OpenID Connect Server.\nSome mistake these capabilities for systems that store user data and log you in. This is not the case. Instead, such a\nserver is responsible for \"translating\" user credentials (typically username and password) to OAuth 2.0 Access and Refresh Tokens\nas well as OpenID Connect ID Tokens. It's basically like you storing cookies with session data, but more flexible and it also\nworks for third party applications.\nORY Hydra does not store user profiles, usernames, passwords. This capability is up to you. ORY Hydra uses something we\ncall a User Login and Consent Flow. This flow uses HTTP redirects to forward any incoming authorization request (\"Please give\nme an access token.\") to the Login Provider and the Consent Provider. These applications are something you implement.\nIt can be a new app or your existing login system. On a high level, these providers can be summarized as:\n\nThe login provider is responsible for authenticating the user (\"login\") by validating his or her credentials (e.g. username + password).\nThe consent provider is responsible for allowing the OAuth 2.0 application to get a token on the user's behalf (\"Do you want\nto allow foobar-app access to all your personal messages and images?\".\n\nA second important concept is the OAuth 2.0 Scope.\nOften, developers confuse OAuth 2.0 Scope with regular Access Control. OAuth 2.0 Scope and, for example, Role Based Access\nControl (RBAC) or Access Control Lists (ACL) cover different aspects of access control.\nYour internal access control will tell you what a user can do in your system. An administrator might modify everything,\na regular user might only be allowed to read personal messages. The OAuth 2.0 Scope does not represent what a resource owner (\"user\") is able to\ndo in a system or not. They do not express things like administrative rights.\nThe OAuth 2.0 Scope expresses what a user allowed an OAuth 2.0 Client (read: \"access token\") to do on his/her behalf.\nFor example, an access token might be allowed to see a user's pictures, but not upload new pictures on his/her behalf.\nThe user him/herself however is generally allowed to view and upload pictures. The OAuth 2.0 Scope do not express a user's permissions.\nThey express what an OAuth 2.0 Client may do on the user's behalf - independently of whether or not the user is actually allowed\nto do that. For example, the user could lie and say that the client is allowed to access some protected resource which\nhe does not have access to (\"Read all classified documents\", but he is not allowed to view any classified documents).\nThis concludes the overview of the two most important pieces of ORY Hydra.\n"},"hydra/3-overview/1-oauth2.html":{"url":"hydra/3-overview/1-oauth2.html","title":"OAuth 2.0 & OpenID Connect","keywords":"","body":"OAuth 2.0 & OpenID Connect\nORY Hydra's primary feature is implementing the OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect spec, as well as related specs by the IETF\nand OpenID Foundation.\nThis section explains how to connect your existing user management (user login, registration, logout, ...) with ORY Hydra\nin order to become an OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect provider like Google, Dropbox, or Facebook.\nPlease be aware that you must know how OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect work.

You will\nfind these terminologies scattered across the OAuth2 and OpenID Connect ecosystem.\nWe decided, for this guide, to use simpler and easier to use terminologies like, for example, user instead of resource owner.\nIf you are familiar with OAuth2 details, you will find it easier to navigate these docs if you have read the glossary.\n\nThe resource owner is the user who authorizes an application to access their account. The application's access to\nthe user's account is limited to the \"scope\" of the authorization granted (e.g. read or write access). We will refer to\nthe resource owner as a user or end user on this page.\nThe OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server implements the OAuth 2.0 protocol (and optionally OpenID Connect) and serves\nendpoints such as /oauth2/auth or /oauth2/token. In our case, this is ORY Hydra.\nThe resource provider is a service that - well - provides resources. These resources (e.g. a blog article, printer, todo list)\nare owned by a resource owner (user) mentioned above.\nThe OAuth 2.0 Client is the application that wants access to a resource owner's resources (a.k.a. get write access to a user's images).\nSuch a client can ask the authorization server to issue an access token on a resource owner's behalf. Typically, the authorization server\nwill ask the user if he/she \"is ok with\" giving that application e.g. write access to personal images.\nThe Identity Provider is a service (\"application\"/\"website\") with a login interface. An identity provider typically\nallows users to register as well and might also have an administrative interface in order to manage the identities (delete user, ban user, create user, ...).\nUser Agent is usually a browser.\nOpenID Connect is a protocol built on top of OAuth 2.0 which is capable of federating authentication.\n\nA typical OAuth 2.0 flow looks as follows:\n\nA developer registers an OAuth 2.0 Client at the Authorization Server (ORY Hydra) with the intention of obtaining information on behalf of a user.\nThe application UI asks the user to authorize the application to access information/data on his/her behalf.\nThe user is redirected to the Authorization Server.\nThe Authorization Server confirms the user's identity and asks the user to grant the OAuth 2.0 Client certain permissions.\nThe Authorization Server issues tokens that the OAuth 2.0 client uses to access resources on the user's behalf.\n\nAuthenticating Users and Requesting Consent\nAs you already know by now, ORY Hydra does not come with any type of user management (login, registration, ...).\nInstead, it relies on the so-called User Login and Consent Flow. This flow describes a series of redirects where the user's\nuser agent is redirect to your Login Provider and, once the user is authenticated, to the Consent Provider. The Login\nand Consent provider is implemented by you in a programming language of your choice. You could write, for example, a\nNodeJS app that handles HTTP requests to /login and /consent and it would thus be your Login & Consent provider.\nThe flow itself works as follows:\n\nThe OAuth 2.0 Client initiates an Authorize Code, Hybrid, or Implicit flow. The user's user agent is redirect to\nhttp://hydra/oauth2/auth?client_id=...&....\nORY Hydra, if unable to authenticate the user (= no session cookie exists), redirects the user's user agent to the Login Provider\nURL. The application \"sitting\" at that URL is implemented by you and typically shows a login user interface (\"Please enter\nyour username and password\"). The URL the user is redirect to looks similar to http://login-service/login?login_challenge=1234....\nThe Login Provider, once the user has successfully logged in, tells ORY Hydra some information about who the user is (e.g. the user's ID)\nand also that the login attempt was successful. This is done using a REST request which includes another redirect URL\nalong the lines of http://hydra/oauth2/auth?client_id=...&...&login_verifier=4321.\nThe user's user agent follows the redirect and lands back at ORY Hydra. Next, ORY Hydra redirects the user's user\nagent to the Consent Provider, hosted at - for example - http://consent-service/consent?consent_challenge=4567...\nThe Consent Provider shows a user interface which asks the user if he/she would like to grant the OAuth 2.0 Client\nthe requested permissions (\"OAuth 2.0 Scope\"). You've probably seen this screen around, which is usually something similar to:\n\"Would you like to grant Facebook Image Backup access to all your private and public images?\".\nThe Consent Provider makes another REST request to ORY Hydra to let it know which permissions the user authorized, and\nif the user authorized the request at all. The user can usually choose to not grant an application any access to his/her\npersonal data. In the response of that REST request, a redirect URL is included along the lines of http://hydra/oauth2/auth?client_id=...&...&consent_verifier=7654....\nThe user's user agent follows that redirect.\nNow, the user has successfully authenticated and authorized the application. Next, ORY Hydra will\nrun some checks and if everything works out, issue access, refresh, and ID tokens.\n\nThis flow allows you to take full control of the behaviour of your login system (e.g. 2FA, passwordless, ...) and\nconsent screen. A well-documented reference implementation for both the Login and Consent Provider is available on GitHub.\nThe flow from a user's point of view\n\nThe flow from a network perspective\n\nImplementing a Login & Consent Provider\nYou should now have a high-level idea of how the login and consent providers work. Let's get into the details of it.\nOAuth 2.0 Authorize Code Flow\nBefore anything happens, the OAuth 2.0 Authorize Code Flow is initiated by an OAuth 2.0 Client. This usually works by\ngenerating a URL in the form of https://hydra/oauth2/auth?client_id=1234&scope=foo+bar&response_type=code&.... Then,\nthe OAuth 2.0 Client points the end user's user agent to that URL.\nNext, the user agent (browser) opens that URL.\nUser Login\nAs the user agent hits the URL, ORY Hydra checks if a session cookie is set containing information about a previously\nsuccessful login. Additionally, parameters such as id_token_hint, prompt, and max_age are evaluated and processed.\nNext, the user will be redirect to the Login Provider which was set using the OAUTH2_LOGIN_URL environment\nvariable. For example, the user is redirected to https://login-provider/login?login_challenge=1234 if OAUTH2_LOGIN_URL=https://login-provider/login.\nThis redirection happens always and regardless of whether the user has a valid login session or if the user needs\nto authenticate.\nThe service which handles requests to https://login-provider/login must first fetch information on the authentication\nrequest using a REST API call. Please be aware that for reasons of brevity, the following code snippets are pseudo-code.\nFor a fully working example, check out our reference User Login & Consent Provider implementation.\nThe endpoint handler at /login must not remember previous sessions. This task is solved by ORY Hydra. If the\nREST API call tells you to show the login ui, you must show it. If the REST API tells you to not show the login ui,\nyou must not show it. Again, do not implement any type of session here.\n// This is node-js pseudo code and will not work if you copy it 1:1\n\nrouter.get('/login', function (req, res, next) {\n    challenge = req.url.query.login_challenge;\n\n    fetch('https://hydra/oauth2/auth/requests/login/' + challenge).\n        then(function (response) {\n            // ...\n        })\n})\nThe server response is a JSON object with the following keys:\n{\n    // Skip, if true, let's us know that ORY Hydra has successfully authenticated the user and we should not show any UI\n    \"skip\": true|false,\n\n    // The user-id of the already authenticated user - only set if skip is true\n    \"subject\": \"user-id\",\n\n    // The OAuth 2.0 client that initiated the request\n    \"client\": {\"id\": \"...\", ...},\n\n    // The initial OAuth 2.0 request url\n    \"request_url\": \"https://hydra/oauth2/auth?client_id=1234&scope=foo+bar&response_type=code&...\",\n\n    // The OAuth 2.0 Scope requested by the client,\n    \"requested_scope\": [\"foo\", \"bar\"],\n\n    // Information on the OpenID Connect request - only required to process if your UI should support these values.\n    \"oidc_context\": {\"ui_locales\": [...], ...}\n}\nFor a full documentation on all available keys, please head over to the API documentation\n(make sure to select the right API version).\nDepending of whether or not skip is true, you will prompt the user to log in by showing him/her a username/password form,\nor by using some other proof of identity.\nIf skip is true, you should not show a user interface but accept the login request directly by making a REST call.\nYou can use this step to update some internal count of how often a user logged in, or do some other custom business logic.\nBut again, do not show the user interface.\nTo accept the login request, do something along the lines of:\n// This is node-js pseudo code and will not work if you copy it 1:1\n\nconst body = {\n    // This is the user ID of the user that authenticated. If `skip` is true, this must be the `subject`\n    // value from the `fetch('https://hydra/oauth2/auth/requests/login/' + challenge)` response:\n    //\n    // subject = response.subject\n    //\n    // Otherwise, this can be a value of your choosing:\n    subject: \"...\",\n\n    // If remember is set to true, then the authentication session will be persisted in the user's browser by ORY Hydra. This will set the `skip` flag to true in future requests that are coming from this user. This value has no effect if `skip` was true.\n    remember: true|false,\n\n    // The time (in seconds) that the cookie should be valid for. Only has an effect if `remember` is true.\n    remember_for: 3600,\n\n    // This value is specified by OpenID connect and optional - it tells OpenID Connect which level of authentication the user performed - for example 2FA or using some biometric data. The concrete values are up to you here.\n    acr: \"..\"\n}\n\nfetch('https://hydra/oauth2/auth/requests/login/' + challenge + '/accept', {\n    method: 'PUT',\n    body: JSON.stringify(body),\n    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }\n}).\n    then(function (response) {\n        // The response will contain a `redirect_to` key which contains the URL where the user's user agent must be redirected to next.\n        res.redirect(response.redirect_to);\n    })\nYou may also choose to deny the login request. This is possible regardless of the skip value.\n// This is node-js pseudo code and will not work if you copy it 1:1\n\nconst body = {\n    error: \"...\", // This is an error ID like `login_required` or `invalid_request`\n    error_description: \"...\" // This is a more detailed description of the error\n}\n\nfetch('https://hydra/oauth2/auth/requests/login/' + challenge + '/reject', {\n    method: 'PUT',\n    body: JSON.stringify(body),\n    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }\n}).\n    then(function (response) {\n        // The response will contain a `redirect_to` key which contains the URL where the user's user agent must be redirected to next.\n        res.redirect(response.redirect_to);\n    })\nUser Consent\nNow that we know who the user is, we must ask the user if he/she wants to grant the requested permissions to the OAuth 2.0 Client.\nTo do so, we check if the user has previously granted that exact OAuth 2.0 Client the requested permissions. If the user\nhas never granted any permissions to the client, or the client requires new permissions not previously granted, the user\nmust visually confirm the request.\nThis works very similar to the User Login Flow.\nFirst, the user will be redirect to the Consent Provider which was set using the OAUTH2_CONSENT_PROVIDER environment\nvariable. For example, the user is redirected to https://consent-provider/consent?consent_challenge=1234 if OAUTH2_CONSENT_PROVIDER=https://consent-provider/consent.\nThis redirection happens always and regardless of whether the user has a valid login session or if the user needs\nto authorize the application or not.\nThe service which handles requests to https://consent-provider/consent must first fetch information on the consent\nrequest using a REST API call. Please be aware that for reasons of brevity, the following code snippets are pseudo-code.\nFor a fully working example, check out our reference User Login & Consent Provider implementation.\n// This is node-js pseudo code and will not work if you copy it 1:1\n\nchallenge = req.url.query.consent_challenge;\n\nfetch('https://hydra/oauth2/auth/requests/consent/' + challenge).\n    then(function (response) {\n        // ...\n    })\nThe server response is a JSON object with the following keys:\n{\n    // Skip, if true, let's us know that the client has previously been granted the requested permissions (scope) by the end-user\n    \"skip\": true|false,\n\n    // The user-id of the user that will grant (or deny) the request\n    \"subject\": \"user-id\",\n\n    // The OAuth 2.0 client that initiated the request\n    \"client\": {\"id\": \"...\", ...},\n\n    // The initial OAuth 2.0 request url\n    \"request_url\": \"https://hydra/oauth2/auth?client_id=1234&scope=foo+bar&response_type=code&...\",\n\n    // The OAuth 2.0 Scope requested by the client,\n    \"requested_scope\": [\"foo\", \"bar\"],\n\n    // Information on the OpenID Connect request - only required to process if your UI should support these values.\n    \"oidc_context\": {\"ui_locales\": [...], ...}\n}\nIf skip is true, you should not show any user interface to the user. Instead, you should accept (or deny) the consent request.\nTypically, you will accept the request unless you have a very good reason to deny it (e.g. the OAuth 2.0 Client is banned).\nIf skip is false and you show the consent screen, you should use the requested_scope array to display a list of permissions\nwhich the user must grant (e.g. using a checkbox). Some people choose to always skip this step if the OAuth 2.0 Client\nis a first-party client - meaning that the client is used by you or your developers in an internal application.\nAssuming the user accepts the consent request, the code looks very familiar to the User Login Flow.\n// This is node-js pseudo code and will not work if you copy it 1:1\n\nconst body = {\n    // A list of permissions the user granted to the OAuth 2.0 Client.

Revoking a login session will remove all of the user's cookies at ORY Hydra and will require\nthe user to re-authenticate when performing the next OAuth 2.0 Authorize Code Flow. Be aware that this option will\nremove all cookies from all devices.\nRevoking the login sessions of a user is as easy as sending DELETE to/oauth2/auth/sessions/login/{user}`.\nConsent\nYou can revoke a user's consent either on a per application basis or for all applications. Revoking the consent will\nautomatically revoke all related access and refresh tokens.\nRevoking all consent sessions of a user is as easy as sending DELETE to/oauth2/auth/sessions/consent/{user}`.\nRevoking the consent sessions of a user for a specific client is as easy as sending DELETE to/oauth2/auth/sessions/consent/{user}/{client}`.\nOAuth 2.0 Scope\nThe scope of an OAuth 2.0 scope defines the permission the token was granted by the user. For example, a specific\ntoken might be allowed to access public pictures, but not private ones. The granted permissions are established during\nthe consent screen.\nAdditionally, ORY Hydra has pre-defined OAuth 2.0 Scope values:\n\noffline and offline_access: Include this scope if you wish to receive a refresh token\nopenid: Include this scope if you wish to perform an OpenID Connect request.\n\nOAuth2 Token Introspection\nOAuth2 Token Introspection is an IETF standard.\nIt defines a method for a protected resource to query\nan OAuth 2.0 authorization server to determine the active state of an\nOAuth 2.0 token and to determine meta-information about this token.\nOAuth 2.0 deployments can use this method to convey information about\nthe authorization context of the token from the authorization server\nto the protected resource.\nYou can find more details on this endpoint in the ORY Hydra API Docs. You can also use\nthe CLI command hydra token introspect .\nOAuth 2.0 Clients\nYou can manage OAuth 2.0 clients using the cli or the HTTP REST API.\n\nCLI: hydra help clients\nREST: Read the API Docs\n\n"},"hydra/3-overview/2-jwk.html":{"url":"hydra/3-overview/2-jwk.html","title":"JSON Web Keys (JWK)","keywords":"","body":"JSON Web Keys (JWK)\n\n\n\nOverview\nAuto-generated JWKs\n\n\n\nOverview\nA JSON Web Key (JWK) is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data structure that represents a cryptographic key and is\nspecified at IETF RFC7517.

We provide a reference implementation which\ncombines both features in one app. Here, we will use deploy that app using Docker.\n$ docker pull oryd/hydra-login-consent-node:v1.0.0-beta.8\n$ docker run -d \\\n  --name ory-hydra-example--consent \\\n  -p 9020:3000 \\\n  --network hydraguide \\\n  -e HYDRA_URL=https://ory-hydra-example--hydra:4445 \\\n  -e NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 \\\n  oryd/hydra-login-consent-node:v1.0.0-beta.8\n\n# Let's check if it's running ok:\n$ docker logs ory-hydra-example--consent\nLet's take a look at the arguments:\n\n-p 9020:3000 exposes this service at port 9020. If you remember, that's the port of the OAUTH2_CONSENT_URL and OAUTH2_LOGIN_URL value\nfrom the ORY Hydra docker container (OAUTH2_CONSENT_URL=http://localhost:9020/consent, OAUTH2_LOGIN_URL=http://localhost:9020/login).\nHYDRA_URL=http://hydra:4445 point to the ORY Hydra Administrative API.\nNODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 disables TLS verification, because we are using self-signed certificates.\n\nPerform OAuth 2.0 Flow\nGreat! Our infrastructure is all set up! Next it's time to perform the OAuth 2.0 Authorize Code flow. For that purpose,\nthe ORY Hydra CLI has a feature that sets up an OAuth 2.0 Consumer and an OAuth 2.0 callback URL. Typically, this would\nbe a third-party application that requests access to a user's resources on your servers - for example a Facebook App you wrote\nthat backs up a user's photos and thus requires read access to the user's photos.\nBefore we go ahead, the OAuth 2.0 Client that performs the request has to be set up. Let's call the client facebook-photo-backup.\nWe have to specify which OAuth 2.0 Grant Types, OAuth 2.0 Scope, OAuth 2.0 Response Types, and Callback URLs the client may request:\n$ docker run --rm -it \\\n  -e HYDRA_ADMIN_URL=https://ory-hydra-example--hydra:4445 \\\n  --network hydraguide \\\n  oryd/hydra:v1.0.0-beta.8 \\\n  clients create --skip-tls-verify \\\n    --id facebook-photo-backup \\\n    --secret some-secret \\\n    --grant-types authorization_code,refresh_token,client_credentials,implicit \\\n    --response-types token,code,id_token \\\n    --scope openid,offline,photos.read \\\n    --callbacks http://127.0.0.1:9010/callback\n\nClient ID: facebook-photo-backup\nClient Secret: some-secret\nLet's dive into some of the arguments:\n\n--skip-tls-verify is supported by all management commands (create/delete/update/... OAuth 2.0 Client, JSON Web Key, ...)\n  and tells the CLI to trust any certificate authority - even self-signed ones. We need this flag because the server\n  uses a self-signed certificate. In production deployments, you would use a certificate signed by a trusted CA.\n--grant-types authorize_code,refresh_token,client_credentials,implicit we want to be able to perform all of these\nOAuth 2.0 flows.\n--response-types token,code,id_token allows us to receive authorize codes, access and refresh tokens, and\nOpenID Connect ID Tokens.\n--scope openid,offline,fotos.read allows the client to request various permissions:\nopenid allows the client to perform the OpenID Connect flow and request an OpenID Connect ID Token.\noffline allows the client to request a refresh token. Because we want to continuously backup photos, the app must be\nable to refresh expired access tokens. This scope allows that.\nphotos.read this is an imaginary scope that is not handled by ORY Hydra but serves the purpose of making it clear that\nwe could request read access to a user's photos. You can obviously omit this scope or use your own scope.\n\n\n--callbacks http://localhost:9010/callback allows the client to request this redirect uri.\n\nPerfect, let's perform an exemplary OAuth 2.0 Authorize Code Flow! To make this easy, the ORY Hydra CLI provides\na helper command called hydra token user. Just imagine this being, for example, passport.js that is generating\nan auth code url, redirecting the browser to it, and then exchanging the authorize code for an access token. The\nsame thing happens with this command:\n$ docker run --rm -it \\\n  --network hydraguide \\\n  -p 9010:9010 \\\n  oryd/hydra:v1.0.0-beta.8 \\\n  token user --skip-tls-verify \\\n    --port 9010 \\\n    --auth-url https://localhost:9000/oauth2/auth \\\n    --token-url https://ory-hydra-example--hydra:4444/oauth2/token \\\n    --client-id facebook-photo-backup \\\n    --client-secret some-secret \\\n    --scope openid,offline,photos.read\n\nSetting up callback listener on http://localhost:9010/callback\nPress ctrl + c on Linux / Windows or cmd + c on OSX to end the process.\nIf your browser does not open automatically, navigate to:\n\n        https://localhost:9010/\nopen the link, as prompted, in your browser, and follow the steps shown there. You might encounter a screen like the following\none:\n\nThis happens because we run ORY Hydra with a self-signed TLS certificate. In production deployments, you would probably\nuse a certificate signed by a trusted CA and not see this screen.\nWhen you see this screen, click on \"Advanced\" and \"Add Exception\" to continue. In some browsers, this might work differently,\nbut it's always possible to proceed.\nWhen completed, you should land at a screen that looks like this one:\n\n"},"hydra/5-security/":{"url":"hydra/5-security/","title":"Security Overview","keywords":"","body":"Security Overview\nHydra is built with tough security in mind.\n\n\n\nOAuth 2.0 Security Overview\nAdvanced Token Validation (Datastore Security)\n\n\nCryptography\nAES-GCM\nRS256\nHMAC-SHA256\nBCrypt\n\n\nHow does Access Control work with Hydra?\n\n\n\nOAuth 2.0 Security Overview\nHydra is an implementation of the security-first Fosite OAuth 2.0 SDK\n(https://github.com/ory/fosite).

GCM uses a nonce (“IV”) that has an upper limit of 2^32 nonces. If more\nnonces are used, there is risk of repeats. This means that you risk collisions when storing more than 2^32\ndocuments authenticated with GCM. Because AES-GCM is only used to encrypt data at rest, this is might\nonly impose a problem if\n\nmore than 2^32 documents are stored using AES-GCM \nan attacker gains access to the datastore where > 2^32 documents are stored \nthe attacker is able to exploit repeats, for example by authenticating malicious documents \n\nRS256\nRSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 using SHA-256 (RS256) is used to sign JWTs. It’s use is recommended by the JWA\nspecification, see https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7518.txt\nThe RSA Key size is 4096 bit long, exceeding the minimum requirement of 2048 bit by\nhttps://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7518.txt.\nRecommendations from NIST, ANSSI, IAD-NSA, BSI, Lenstra and others vary between 1300 and 2048 bit key\nlengths for asymmetric cryptography based on discrete logarithms (RSA). 4096 exceeds all recommendations\nfor 2017 from all authorities, see https://www.keylength.com/en/compare/.\nHMAC-SHA256\nHMAC (FIPS 198) with SHA256 (FIPS 180-4) is used to sign access tokens, authorize codes and refresh\ntokens. SHA-2 (with 256 bit) is encouraged by NIST, see\nhttp://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/policy.html\nBCrypt\nBCrypt is used to hash client credentials at rest. It is not officially recommended by NIST as\nit is not based on hashing primitives such as SHA-2, but rather on Blowfish. However, BCrypt is\nmuch stronger than any other (salted) hashing method for passwords, has wide adoption\nand is an official golang/x library.\nI recommend reading this thread on Security Stack Exchange on BCrypt, SCrypt\nand PBKDF2: https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/4781/do-any-security-experts-recommend-bcrypt-for-password-storage\nBe aware that BCrypt causes very high CPU loads, depending on the Workload Factor. We\nstrongly advise reducing the number of requests that use Basic Authorization.\nHow does Access Control work with Hydra?\nHydra supports two concepts of authorization. One is called Token Introspection which is a standard\nby the IETF ( https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7662 ). It is primarily\ntargeted at third-party services and is usually used by a programmatic API. It can be used by first-party\nservices too. The sole purpose of this endpoint is to check whether an access token is valid or not.\n"},"hydra/6-how-to/":{"url":"hydra/6-how-to/","title":"How To","keywords":"","body":"How To\n\n"},"hydra/6-how-to/1-production.html":{"url":"hydra/6-how-to/1-production.html","title":"ORY Hydra in Production","keywords":"","body":"ORY Hydra in Production\nThis page aims to help you setting up a production system with ORY Hydra.\n\n\n\nConfiguration\nLinux / OSX\nWindows\nCommand Prompt\nPowershell\n\n\nDocker\n\n\nORY Hydra behind an API Gateway\nTLS Termination\nRouting\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration\nAll configuration of ORY Hydra is currently done via environment variables.

We strongly recommend running ORY Hydra behind an API gateway or a load balancer.\nIt is common to terminate TLS on the edge (gateway / load balancer) and use certificates provided by your infrastructure\nprovider (e.g. AWS CA) for last mile security.\nTLS Termination\nYou may also choose to set Hydra to HTTPS mode without actually accepting TLS connections. In that case,\nall Hydra URLs are prefixed with https://, but the server is actually accepting http. This makes sense if you don't want\nlast mile security using TLS, and trust your network to properly handle internal traffic. To use this setting, check\nfor HTTPS_ALLOW_TERMINATION_FROM in hydra help host.\nWith TLS termination enabled, ORY Hydra discards all requests unless:\n\nThe request is coming from a trusted IP address set by HTTPS_ALLOW_TERMINATION_FROM and the header X-Forwarded-Proto is set to https.\nThe request goes to /health/status which does not require TLS termination and that is used to check the health of an instance.\n\nIf you are unable to properly set up TLS Termination, you may want to set the --dangerous-force-http flag. But please be\naware that we discourage you from doing so and that you should know what you're doing.\nRouting\nIt is common to use a router, or API gateway, to route subdomains or paths to a specific service. For example, https://myservice.com/hydra/\nis routed to http://10.0.1.213:3912/ where 10.0.1.213 is the host running ORY Hydra. To compute the values for\nthe consent challenge, ORY Hydra uses the host and path headers from the HTTP request. Therefore, it is important\nto set up your API Gateway in such a way, that it passes the public host (in this case myservice.com) and the path\nwithout any prefix (in this case hydra/). If you use the Mashape Kong API gateway, you can achieve this by setting\nstrip_request_path=true and preserve_host=true.\n"},"hydra/6-how-to/2-architecture.html":{"url":"hydra/6-how-to/2-architecture.html","title":"Integrating ORY Hydra","keywords":"","body":"Integrating ORY Hydra\nThis article explains how you to integrate ORY Hydra in your system.\n\n\n\nOverview\nInteracting with OAuth 2.0\nValidating OAuth 2.0 Access Tokens\nNodeJS\nCURL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview\nA high-level overview of the interaction between a client, ORY Hydra (Authorization Server) and an API looks as follows:\n[`sequenceDiagram\n  participant Client\n  participant ORY Hydra\n  participant API\n  Client->>ORY Hydra: Perform OAuth 2.0 Flow\n  ORY Hydra->>Client: Access Token\n  Client->>API: Request with Access Token\n  API->ORY Hydra: Validates Access Token\n  API->>Client: Response`](./images/basic-oauth2-system.png)\nMost of what is explained here can also be seen as real-life examples in the ory/examples\nrepository!\nInteracting with OAuth 2.0\nPlease, do not write your own code to interact with OAuth 2.0.

Read it now!\nCreating a public OAuth 2.0 Client\nYou can create a public OAuth 2.0 Client (e.g. for the authorize code + PKCE or implicit flow) with the CLI\nhydra clients create --endpoint http://ory-hydra-admin-api --token-endpoint-auth-method none\nor by setting in the HTTP API JSON body when POSTing to /clients:\n{\n    \"client_id\": \"...\",\n    \"token_endpoint_auth_method\": \"none\"\n}\nBe aware that when making requests to /oauth2/token with a public OAuth 2.0 Client, you can not authenticate with the\nHTTP Basic Authorization but must include the client_id in the POST body.\nKey rotation\nKey rotation is simple with ORY Hydra. You can rotate OpenID Connect ID Token and OAuth 2.0 Access Tokens (JSON Web Token)\nkeys with one simple command.\nORY Hydra takes the latest key from the key store to sign JSON Web Tokens. All public keys will be shown at\nhttp://ory-hydra-public-api/.well-known/jwks.json.\nOpenID Connect ID Token\nhydra keys create --endpoint=http://ory-hydra-admin-api/ hydra.openid.id-token -a RS256\nOAuth 2.0 Access Tokens (JSON Web Token)\nhydra keys create --endpoint=http://ory-hydra-admin-api/ hydra.jwt.access-token -a RS256\nOAuth 2.0\nJSON Web Tokens\nORY Hydra supports JSON Web Tokens as Access Tokens. We discourage you from using this feature for multiple reasons:\n\nIt is very new and has not been battle-tested.\nWe believe that JSON Web Tokens can lead to poor security practices.\nUsing this feature disables other features, like the pairwise Subject Identifier Algorithm.\n\nIf you still want to use this strategy you can do so by setting environment variable OAUTH2_ACCESS_TOKEN_STRATEGY=jwt.\nBe aware that only access tokens are formatted as JSON Web Tokens. Refresh tokens are not impacted by this strategy.\nBy performing OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection you can check if the token is still valid. If a token is revoked or otherwise\nblacklisted, the OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection will return { \"active\": false }. This is useful when you do not want\nto rely only on the token's expiry.\nJSON Web Token Validation\nYou can validate JSON Web Tokens issued by ORY Hydra by pointing your jwt library (e.g. node-jwks-rsa)\nto http://ory-hydra-public-api/.well-known/jwks.json. All necessary keys are available there.\nOAuth 2.0 Client Authentication with RSA private/public keypairs\nORY Hydra supports OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication with RSA private/public keypairs. This authentication method\nreplaces the classic HTTP Basic Authorization and HTTP POST Authorization schemes. Instead of sending the client_id\nand client_secret, you authenticate the client with a signed JSON Web Token.\nTo enable this feature for a specific OAuth 2.0 Client, you must set token_endpoint_auth_method to private_key_jwt\nand register the public key of the RSA signing key either using the jwks_uri or jwks fields of the client.\nWhen authenticating the client at the token endpoint, you generate and sign (with the RSA private key) a JSON Web Token\nwith the following claims:\n\niss: REQUIRED. Issuer. This MUST contain the client_id of the OAuth Client.\nsub: REQUIRED. Subject. This MUST contain the client_id of the OAuth Client.\naud: REQUIRED. Audience. The aud (audience) Claim. Value that identifies the Authorization Server (ORY Hydra) as an\nintended audience. The Authorization Server MUST verify that it is an intended audience for the token.\nThe Audience SHOULD be the URL of the Authorization Server's Token Endpoint.\njti: REQUIRED. JWT ID. A unique identifier for the token, which can be used to prevent reuse of the token.\nThese tokens MUST only be used once, unless conditions for reuse were negotiated between the parties; any such\nnegotiation is beyond the scope of this specification.\nexp: REQUIRED. Expiration time on or after which the ID Token MUST NOT be accepted for processing.\niat: OPTIONAL. Time at which the JWT was issued.\n\nWhen making a request to the /oauth2/token endpoint, you include client_assertion_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer\nand client_assertion= in the request body:\nPOST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1\nHost: my-hydra.com\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\ngrant_type=authorization_code&\ncode=i1WsRn1uB1&\nclient_id=s6BhdRkqt3&\nclient_assertion_type=\nurn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Aclient-assertion-type%3Ajwt-bearer&\nclient_assertion=PHNhbWxwOl ...

The salt\nis used to obfuscate the sub value.\nThis value should not be changed once set in production. Changing it will cause all client applications\nto receive new user IDs from ORY Hydra which will lead to serious complications with authentication on their side!\nEach OAuth 2.0 Client has a configuration field subject_type. The value of that subject_type is either public or\npairwise. If the mode is enabled by IDC_SUBJECT_TYPES_SUPPORTED, then ORY Hydra will choose the right strategy automatically.\nWhile ORY Hydra handles sub obfuscation out of the box, you may also override this value with your own obfuscated\nsub value by setting force_subject_identifier when accepting the login challenge in your user login app.\nSystem Secret Rotation\nWe advise to rotate the system secret from time to time. The system secret is used to sign and validate OAuth 2.0 Access\nand Refresh Tokens and to encrypt JSON Web Keys in the store. If you use the JWT strategy for OAuth 2.0 Access Tokens,\nthe system secret has no effect on these.\nTo rotate the system secret (only possible with SQL at the moment), follow this guide:\n\nShutdown all ORY Hydra instances\nRun OLD_SYSTEM_SECRET=foo NEW_SYSTEM_SECRET=bar hydra migrate secret db://url/...\nDecide if access/refresh tokens signed with the old key should still be valid.\nIf yes, set ROTATED_SYSTEM_SECRET to the old secret before starting hydra serve ..., and SYSTEM_SECRET to the new one.\nIf not, set only SYSTEM_SECRET to the new secret before running hydra serve ....\n\n\nRestart ORY Hydra instances.\n\n"},"hydra/6-how-to/4-debug.html":{"url":"hydra/6-how-to/4-debug.html","title":"Debugging","keywords":"","body":"Debugging\nSpec-compliant OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect is hard.

ORY Hydra has extensive logging and you will find the issue most likely in the logs. Here is an example\nlog line for a client that requested a redirect URL that did not match the whitelisted redirect URLS: time=\"2018-08-07T16:01:16Z\" level=error msg=\"An error occurred\" description=\"The request is missing a required parameter, includes an invalid parameter value, includes a parameter more than once, or is otherwise malformed\" error=invalid_request hint=\"The \\\"redirect_uri\\\" parameter does not match any of the OAuth 2.0 Client's pre-registered redirect urls.\"\nCheck the URL because of two reasons:\nORY Hydra sends error_hint, error, error_description, error_debug in the URL. You will find the\ncause of the error most likely in there.\nYou are maybe in the wrong URL. Make sure the host and port and path is correct. This happens often, especially\nwhen you're just starting out and experimenting\n\n\nSet environment variable OAUTH2_SHARE_ERROR_DEBUG=true. Do not do this in production, it is possible, though unlikely,\nthat important data leaks with this. If set to true, ORY Hydra will set the error_debug query parameter if debug\ninformation is available.\nIf you're just starting out and experimenting your docker set up does not work at all:\nStop all containers\nRemove them (unless you have something important running)\nRetry. This can help a lot if you are new to this!\n\n\n\nOAuth 2.0 Authorize Code Flow fails\nThe most likely cause is misconfiguration, summarized in the next sections.\nWrong or misconfigured OAuth 2.0 Client\nYou are using the wrong OAuth 2.0 Client or the OAuth 2.0 Client has a broken configuration. To check that\nyou're using the right client, run:\nhydra clients get --endpoint http://ory-hydra \nThe result shows you the whole client (excluding its secret). Check that the values are correct. Example:\n{\n        \"client_id\": \"my-client\",\n        \"grant_types\": [\n                \"authorization_code\"\n        ],\n        \"jwks\": {},\n        \"redirect_uris\": [\n                \"http://127.0.0.1:5556/callback\"\n        ],\n        \"response_types\": [\n                \"code\"\n        ],\n        \"scope\": \"openid offline\",\n        \"subject_type\": \"pairwise\",\n        \"token_endpoint_auth_method\": \"client_secret_basic\",\n        \"userinfo_signed_response_alg\": \"none\"\n}\nRedirect URL is not whitelisted\nA likely cause of your request failing is that you are using the wrong redirect URL. Assuming your OAuth 2.0\nURL looks like http://ory-hydra/oauth2/auth?client_id=my-client&...&redirect_uri=http://my-url/callback\nThe redirect URL http://my-url/callback must be whitelisted in your client configuration. The URLs must match exactly.\nURL http://my-url/callback and http://my-url/callback?foo=bar are different URLs!\nTo see the whitelisted redirect_uris, check the client:\nhydra clients get --endpoint http://ory-hydra \n\n{\n        // ...\n        \"redirect_uris\": [\n                \"http://127.0.0.1:5556/callback\"\n        ],\n        // ...\n}\nHere you see that http://my-url/callback is not in the list, which is why the request fails.\nOAuth 2.0 Client ID and secret are sent in body instead of header\nThere are multiple ways of authenticating OAuth 2.0 Clients at the /oauth2/token:\n\nHTTP Basic Authorization (client_secret_basic) - the OAuth 2.0 Client ID and secret are sent in the HTTP Header (Authorization: basic ....)\nHTTP Body (client_secret_post) - the OAuth 2.0 Client ID and secret are sent in the POST body (Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded)\n\nBoth are valid schemes. But the OAuth 2.0 Client has to be configured to allow either of the one. Per default, the OAuth 2.0\nClient allows HTTP Basic Authorization only. You can check which method is allowed:\nhydra clients get --endpoint http://ory-hydra \n{\n        // ...\n        \"token_endpoint_auth_method\": \"client_secret_basic\",\n        // ...\n}\nAs you can see, this client is allowed to authorize using HTTP Basic Authorization. If you try to authorize with the client\ncredentials in the POST body, the authentication process will fail. To allow a client to perform the POST authorization\nscheme, you must set \"token_endpoint_auth_method\": \"client_secret_post\". You can do this in the CLI with the\n--token-endpoint-auth-method flag.\nDistributed Tracing\nWhat is this?\nConfiguring Distributed Tracing (DT) will enable you to obtain a visualization of the call paths that take place in order to process a request made to Hydra. It's yet another tool that you can use to aid you in profiling, debugging and ultimately understanding your deployment of Hydra better. Hydra currently supports the following tracing options:\n\nTracing backend(s): Jaeger - Note: adding support for other opentracing compliant backends is planned. To aid in priority, please create an issue with your feature request.\nFollowing existing traces: If you have deployed Hydra behind a proxy that has initiated a trace, Hydra will attempt to join that trace by examining the request headers for tracing context.\n\nWhat a Hydra trace includes\nIn DT speak, a trace is comprised of one or more spans which are logical units of work. Each Hydra span is encapsulated with the following state:\n\nA name\nA start time\nA finish time\nA set of zero or more tags\n\nHydra currently creates the following spans:\n\nTop level span (named after the request path) for the requested endpoint. Span tags:\nhttp method\nhttp status code\nerror IFF status code >= 400\n\n\nChild span will be created if bcrypt (e.g. when the token endpoint is called) is called. Span tags:\nbcrypt work factor\n\n\nAll SQL database interactions. Spans/tags will vary depending on the database driver used.\n\nThis is still evolving and subject to change as tracing support continues to expand in Hydra. If you see something that is missing/wrong, please create an issue.\nAlright, how can I set this up locally?\nThe provided docker-compose file in the project repository has tracing configuration w/ jaeger added which you can use to play around with. Simply uncomment the configurations associated with tracing as so:\nUnder the Hydra service definition depends_on configs, uncomment the following:\n- jaeger\nUnder the Hydra service definition environment configs, uncomment the following:\n- TRACING_PROVIDER\n- TRACING_PROVIDER_JAEGER_SAMPLING_SERVER_URL\n- TRACING_PROVIDER_JAEGER_LOCAL_AGENT_ADDRESS\n- TRACING_PROVIDER_JAEGER_SAMPLING_TYPE\n- TRACING_PROVIDER_JAEGER_SAMPLING_VALUE\nUncomment the Jaeger service definition:\njaeger:\n  image: jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.7.0\n  ports:\n  - \"5775:5775/udp\"\n  - \"6831:6831/udp\"\n  - \"6832:6832/udp\"\n  - \"5778:5778\"\n  - \"16686:16686\"\n  - \"14268:14268\"\n  - \"9411:9411\"\nThen simply run docker-compose up. Grab a coffee or stretch while you wait for everything to come up. You will then be able to navigate to the Jaeger UI\nwhich you have exposed on port 16686 at http://localhost:16686/search. You can now start making requests to Hydra and inspect traces!\nAs an example, here is a trace created by making a bad request to the POST /clients endpoint:\n\nAt a glance, you are able to see that:\n\nThe request failed\nThe request took ~80ms\nIt resulted in a 409\nThe hash comparison to validate the client's credentials took a whopping 70ms. Bcrypt is expensive!\nThe various database operations performed\n\nNote: in order to see spans around database interactions, you must be using a SQL backend (i.e. MySQL or Postgres).\nTracing configurations\nThe CLI will provide you with the list of Hydra tracing configurations and their supported values.

The ROCP grant is something from the \"dark ages\" of OAuth2 and there are suitable replacements for mobile clients, such as public oauth2 clients, which are supported by Hydra: https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-native-apps-09\nThe OAuth2 Thread Model explicitly states that the ROPC grant is commonly used in legacy/migration scenarios, and\n\n  This grant type has higher\n   risk because it maintains the UID/password anti-pattern.\n   Additionally, because the user does not have control over the\n   authorization process, clients using this grant type are not limited   by scope but instead have potentially the same capabilities as the\n   user themselves.  As there is no authorization step, the ability to\n   offer token revocation is bypassed.\nBecause passwords are often used for more than 1 service, this\n   anti-pattern may also put at risk whatever else is accessible with\n   the supplied credential.  Additionally, any easily derived equivalent\n   (e.g., joe@example.com and joe@example.net) might easily allow\n   someone to guess that the same password can be used elsewhere.\n   Impact: The resource server can only differentiate scope based on the\n   access token being associated with a particular client.  The client\n   could also acquire long-lived tokens and pass them up to an\n   attacker's web service for further abuse.  The client, eavesdroppers,\n   or endpoints could eavesdrop the user id and password.\n   o  Except for migration reasons, minimize use of this grant type.\n\n\nsource\n\nThus, I decided to not implement the ROPC grant in Hydra. Over time, I will add documentation how to deal with mobile scenarios and similar.\nShould I use OAuth2 tokens for authentication?\nOAuth2 tokens are like money. It allows you to buy stuff, but the cashier does not really care if the money is\nyours or if you stole it, as long as it's valid money. Depending on what you understand as authentication, this is a yes and no answer:\n\nYes: You can use access tokens to find out which user (\"subject\") is performing an action in a resource provider (blog article service, shopping basket, ...).\nComing back to the money example: You, the subject, receives a cappuccino from the vendor (resource provider) in exchange for money (access token).\nNo: Never use access tokens for logging people in, for example http://myapp.com/login?access_token=....\nComing back to the money example: The police officer (\"authentication server\") will not accept money (\"access token\") as a proof of identity (\"it's really you\"). Unless he is corrupt (\"vulnerable\"), of course.\n\nIn the second example (\"authentication server\"), you must use OpenID Connect ID Tokens.\nHow to deal with mobile apps?\nRead this article.\nHow should I run migrations?\nSince ORY Hydra 0.8.0, migrations are no longer run automatically on boot. This is required in production environments,\nbecause:\n\nAlthough SQL migrations are tested, migrating schemas can cause data loss and should only be done consciously with\nprior back ups.\nRunning a production system with a user that has right such as ALTER TABLE is a security anti-pattern.\n\nThus, to initialize the database schemas, it is required to run hydra migrate sql driver://user:password@host:port/db before running\nhydra host.\nWhat does the installation process look like?\n\nRun hydra migrate sql ... on a host close to the database (e.g. a virtual machine with access to the SQL instance).\n\nWhat does a migration process look like?\n\nMake sure a database update is required by checking the release notes.\nMake a back up of the database.\nRun the migration script on a host close to the database (e.g. a virtual machine with access to the SQL instance).\nSchemas are usually backwards compatible, so instances running previous versions of ORY Hydra should keep working fine.\nIf backwards compatibility is not given, this will be addressed in the patch notes.\nUpgrade all ORY Hydra instances.\n\nHow can I do this in docker?\nMany deployments of ORY Hydra use Docker. Although several options are available, we advise to extend the ORY Hydra Docker\nimage\nDockerfile\nFROM oryd/hydra:tag\n\nENTRYPOINT /go/bin/hydra migrate sql $DATABASE_URL\nand run it in your infrastructure once.\nAdditionally, but not recommended, it is possible to override the entry point of the ORY Hydra Docker image using CLI flag\n--entrypoint \"hydra migrate sql $DATABASE_URL; hydra host\" or with entrypoint: hydra migrate sql $DATABASE_URL; hydra host\nset in your docker compose config.\nCan I set the log level to warn, error, debug, ...?\nYes, you can do so by setting the environment variable LOG_LEVEL=. There are various levels supported:\n\ndebug\ninfo\nwarn\nerror\nfatal\npanic\n\nHow can I import TLS certificates?\nYou can import TLS certificates when running hydra host. This can be done by setting the following environment variables:\nRead from file\n\nHTTPS_TLS_CERT_PATH: The path to the TLS certificate (pem encoded).\nHTTPS_TLS_KEY_PATH: The path to the TLS private key (pem encoded).\n\nEmbedded\n\nHTTPS_TLS_CERT: A pem encoded TLS certificate passed as string. Can be used instead of TLS_CERT_PATH.\nHTTPS_TLS_KEY: A pem encoded TLS key passed as string. Can be used instead of TLS_KEY_PATH.\n\nOr by specifying the following flags:\n--https-tls-cert-path string   Path to the certificate file for HTTP/2 over TLS (https). You can set HTTPS_TLS_KEY_PATH or HTTPS_TLS_KEY instead.\n--https-tls-key-path string    Path to the key file for HTTP/2 over TLS (https). You can set HTTPS_TLS_KEY_PATH or HTTPS_TLS_KEY instead.\nIs there an HTTP API Documentation?\nYes, it is available at Apiary.\nHow can I disable HTTPS for testing?\nYou can do so by running hydra host --dangerous-force-http.\nMySQL gives unsupported Scan, storing driver.Value type []uint8 into type *time.Time\n\ndid a quick test to get mysql running, but run into migrate sql issue - seems mysql related\nAn error occurred while running the migrations: Could not apply ladon SQL migrations: Could not migrate sql schema, applied 0 migrations: sql: Scan error on column index 0: unsupported Scan, storing driver.Value type []uint8 into type *time.Time\nis this a known bug ? or any specific mysql version which is required (running 5.7) ?\n\n$ hydra help host\n...\n   - MySQL: If DATABASE_URL is a DSN starting with mysql:// MySQL will be used as storage backend.\n        Example: DATABASE_URL=mysql://user:password@tcp(host:123)/database?parseTime=true\n\n        Be aware that the ?parseTime=true parameter is mandatory, or timestamps will not work.\n...\nThe docker image exits immediately\nCheck the logs using docker logs .\nInsufficient Entropy\n\nHey there , I am getting this error when I try request an access token \"The request used a security parameter (e.g., anti-replay, anti-csrf) with insufficient entropy (minimum of 8 characters)\"\nKareem Diaa @kimooz Jun 07 16:41Hey there , I am getting this error when I try request an access token \"The request used a security parameter (e.g., anti-replay, anti-csrf) with insufficient entropy (minimum of 8 characters)\"\nAeneas @arekkas Jun 07 16:41@kimooz make sure state and nonce are set in your auth code url (http://hydra/oauth2/auth?client_id=...&nonce=THIS_NEEDS_TO_BE_SET&state=THIS_ALSO_NEEDS_TO_BE_SET\n\nI get compile errors!\n\nI would try deleting the vendor dir and glide’s files and try glide init again or clear Glide’s global cache.\nfollow the steps in the readme https://github.com/ory/hydra#building-from-source\n\nIs JWT supported?\n\nMufid @mufid 03:29Could Hydra's Access Token be a JWT?

Then:\n\nIf the request hits the ORY Oathkeeper proxy (oathkeeper serve proxy): The request will be forwarded to the upstream URL.\nIf the request hits the ORY Oathkeeper judge (oathkeeper serve api -> /judge/some-route): The server will respond with\nstatus code 200 if the request is valid and any other status code if not.\n\nThe match.url value is capable of parsing regular expressions. Value http://my-app/some-route will only\nmatch this exact URL, not http://my-app/some-route/foo, http://my-app/some-ROUTE, nor https://my-app/some-route.\nRegular expressions are delimited with  and >. A match.url value of http://my-app/some-route will match\nhttp://my-app/some-route/foo, http://my-app/some-route, http://my-app/some-routeABCDEF, and so on. You can\nuse multiple regular expressions: ://my-app/some-route.\nThe match.methods value defines which HTTP methods this access rule will match. The rule some-id will, for example,\nnot match POST requests.\nORY Oathkeeper will throw an error if more than one access rule is found for a given HTTP request. You have to make sure\nthat your access rules don't overlap.\nOnce an access rule is matched, ORY Oathkeeper will authenticate the credentials, authorize the request subject (e.g. the user),\nand transform the credentials. More on that in the next sections.\nAuthenticators\nAn authenticator is responsible for authenticating request credentials. ORY Oathkeeper supports different authenticators\nand we will add more as the project progresses.\nAn authenticator inspects the HTTP request (e.g. the HTTP Authorization Header) and executes some business logic that\nreturns true (for authentication ok) or false (for authentication invalid) as well as a subject ID. The subject ID is\ntypically the \"user\" that made the request, but it could also be a machine (if you have machine-2-machine interaction) or\nsomething different.\nEach authenticator has the same configuration layout\n\"authenticators\": [\n    {\n        \"handler\": \"a\",\n        \"config\": {/* depends on the authenticator */}\n    }\n]\nwhere handler is the name of the authenticator and config is an optional configuration for that specific\nauthenticator.\nYou can define more than one authenticator in the access rule. The first authenticator that is able to handle the\ncredentials will be consulted and other authenticators will be ignored:\n\"authenticators\": [\n    {\n        \"handler\": \"a\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"handler\": \"b\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"handler\": \"c\"\n    }\n]\nIf handler a is able to handle the provided credentials, then handler b and c will be ignored. If handler a\ncan not handle the provided credentials but handler b can, then handler a and c will be ignored. Handling\nthe provided credentials means that the authenticator knows how to handle, for example, the Authorization: basic header.\nIt does not mean that the credentials are valid! If a handler encounters invalid credentials, then other handlers will be ignored too.\nLet's take a look at the different supported authenticators!\nnoop\nThis is a special authenticator. It tells ORY Oathkeeper to bypass the authentication process. This also implies\nthat no authorization will be executed and no credentials will be issued. It's basically a pass-all authenticator\nthat allows any request to be forwarded to the upstream URL.\nExample\nThe following rule allows all requests to GET http://my-app/some-route:\n{\n    \"id\": \"some-id\",\n    \"upstream\": {\n        \"url\": \"http://my-backend-service\"\n    },\n    \"match\": {\n        \"url\": \"http://my-app/some-route\",\n        \"methods\": [\n            \"GET\"\n        ]\n    },\n    \"authenticators\": [{\n        \"handler\": \"noop\"\n    }]\n}\nanonymous\nThe anonymous authenticator checks whether or not an Authorization header is set. If not, it will use the value\nof the environment variable AUTHENTICATOR_ANONYMOUS_USERNAME as the subject name.\nExample\nThe following rule allows all requests to GET http://my-app/some-route and sets the subject name to the value\nof the environment variable AUTHENTICATOR_ANONYMOUS_USERNAME, as long as no Authorization header is set in the\nHTTP request:\n{\n    \"id\": \"some-id\",\n    \"upstream\": {\n        \"url\": \"http://my-backend-service\"\n    },\n    \"match\": {\n        \"url\": \"http://my-app/some-route\",\n        \"methods\": [\n            \"GET\"\n        ]\n    },\n    \"authenticators\": [{\n        \"handler\": \"anonymous\"\n    }],\n    /* ... */\n}\noauth2_client_credentials\nThis oauth2_client_credentials uses the username and password from HTTP Basic Authorization (Authorization: basic base64()\nto perform the OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials grant in order to detect if the provided credentials are valid.\nTo use this authenticator, you must provide the environment variable AUTHENTICATOR_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CREDENTIALS_TOKEN_URL\nwhich sets the OAuth 2.0 Token URL that should be used to check if the provided credentials are valid or not. For\nexample, you could set it as follows:\n$ export AUTHENTICATOR_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CREDENTIALS_TOKEN_URL=https://my-oauth2-server/oauth2/token\nThis authenticator will use the username from the HTTP Basic Authorization header as the subject for this request.\nThis authenticator has one configuration option which is required_scope. This option sets what scope is\nrequired by the URL and when making performing OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials request, the scope will be included\nin the request.\nExample\nThe following rule allows requests to GET http://my-app/some-route if valid a OAuth 2.0 Client ID and Client Secret\nhas been provided and if that client is allowed to request scope scope-a and scope-b:\n{\n    \"id\": \"some-id\",\n    \"upstream\": {\n        \"url\": \"http://my-backend-service\"\n    },\n    \"match\": {\n        \"url\": \"http://my-app/some-route\",\n        \"methods\": [\n            \"GET\"\n        ]\n    },\n    \"authenticators\": [{\n        \"handler\": \"oauth2_client_credentials\",\n        \"config\": {\n            \"required_scope\": [\"scope-a\", \"scope-b\"]\n        }\n    }],\n    /* ... */\n}\noauth2_introspection\nThe oauth2_introspection authenticator handles requests that have an Bearer Token in the Authorization Header (Authorization: bearer ).\nIt then uses OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection to check if the token is valid and if the token was granted the requested scope.\nThis authenticator is a bit more complex to set up. You have to define the following environment variables:\n\nRequired\nAUTHENTICATOR_OAUTH2_INTROSPECTION_URL: The OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection URL.\n\n\nIn cases where the OAuth 2.0 Introspection Endpoint is protected and requires an OAuth 2.0 Access Token, you can configure\nORY Oathkeeper to authorize before making requests to that endpoint with the following, optional, settings:\nAUTHENTICATOR_OAUTH2_INTROSPECTION_CLIENT_ID: The OAuth 2.0 Client ID the client that performs the OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection. The OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection\nendpoint is typically protected and requires a valid OAuth 2.0 Client in order to check if a token is valid or not.\nAUTHENTICATOR_OAUTH2_INTROSPECTION_CLIENT_SECRET: The OAuth 2.0 Client Secret of the client that performs the OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection.\nAUTHENTICATOR_OAUTH2_INTROSPECTION_TOKEN_URL: The OAuth 2.0 Token URL.\nAUTHENTICATOR_OAUTH2_INTROSPECTION_SCOPE: If the OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection endpoint requires a certain OAuth 2.0 Scope\nin order to be accessed, you can set it using this environment variable. Use commas to define more than one OAuth 2.0 Scope.\nExample: AUTHENTICATOR_OAUTH2_INTROSPECTION_SCOPE=scope-a,scope-b\nAUTHENTICATOR_OAUTH2_INTROSPECTION_SCOPE_STRATEGY: The strategy to be used to validate the scope claim. Strategies HIERARCHIC, EXACT,\nWILDCARD, NONE are supported. Defaults to EXACT.

Usually something like https://my-keys.com/.well-known/jwks.json. The response\nof that endpoint must return a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS).\n\n\nOptional\nAUTHENTICATOR_JWT_SCOPE_STRATEGY: The strategy to be used to validate the scope claim. Strategies HIERARCHIC, EXACT,\nWILDCARD, NONE are supported. Defaults to EXACT. For more information on scope strategies, click here-\n\n\n\nExample\nThe following rule allows requests to GET http://my-app/some-route if valid a JSON Web Token was provided\nand if that token has scope scope-a and scope-b, audience aud-1 and was issued by iss-1. All configuration\nitems are optional and ignored if left out.\n{\n    \"id\": \"some-id\",\n    \"upstream\": {\n        \"url\": \"http://my-backend-service\"\n    },\n    \"match\": {\n        \"url\": \"http://my-app/some-route\",\n        \"methods\": [\n            \"GET\"\n        ]\n    },\n    \"authenticators\": [{\n        \"handler\": \"jwt\",\n        \"config\": {\n            \"required_scope\": [\"scope-a\", \"scope-b\"],\n            \"require_audience\": [\"scope-a\", \"scope-b\"],\n            \"trusted_issuers\": [\"scope-a\", \"scope-b\"],\n        }\n    }],\n    /* ... */\n}\nPer default, this authenticator accepts JSON Web Tokens signed with the RS256 algorithm only. You can change that\nby whitelisting the algorithms to be allowed. All common JWT singing algorihtms (except none) are supported:\n{\n    /* ... */\n    \"authenticators\": [{\n        \"handler\": \"jwt\",\n        \"config\": {\n            \"allowed_algorithms\": [\"RS256\", \"HS256\", \"RS512\", \"ES256\"]\n        }\n    }],\n    /* ... */\n}\nAuthorizers\nThe authorizer takes the subject returned from the authenticator and checks if that subject is allowed to perform\nthe requested action.\nEach authorizer has the same configuration layout\n\"authorizer\": {\n    \"handler\": \"a\",\n    \"config\": {/* depends on the authorizer */}\n}\nallow\nThis authorizer allows every request to pass.\nExample\n{\n    \"id\": \"some-id\",\n    \"upstream\": {\n        \"url\": \"http://my-backend-service\"\n    },\n    \"match\": {\n        \"url\": \"http://my-app/some-route\",\n        \"methods\": [\n            \"GET\"\n        ]\n    },\n    \"authenticators\": [/* ... */],\n    \"authorizer\": {\n        \"handler\": \"allow\"\n    }\n    /* ... */\n}\ndeny\nThis authorizer denies every request.\nExample\n{\n    \"id\": \"some-id\",\n    \"upstream\": {\n        \"url\": \"http://my-backend-service\"\n    },\n    \"match\": {\n        \"url\": \"http://my-app/some-route\",\n        \"methods\": [\n            \"GET\"\n        ]\n    },\n    \"authenticators\": [/* ... */],\n    \"authorizer\": {\n        \"handler\": \"deny\"\n    }\n    /* ... */\n}\nketo_warden\nThis authorizer uses the ORY Keto Warden API to perform sophisticated access control with access control policies.\nPlease familiarize yourself with the ORY Keto project before you set up this authorizer.\nTo configure this authorizer, you must set the environment variable AUTHORIZER_KETO_WARDEN_KETO_URL to ORY Keto's URL,\nfor example AUTHORIZER_KETO_WARDEN_KETO_URL=http://keto/. If this environment variable is not set, then this authorizer\nwill be disabled.\nThis authorizer has three configuration options, required_action, required_resource and subject:\n\"authorizer\": {\n    \"handler\": \"keto_warden\",\n    \"config\": {\n        \"required_action\": \"...\",\n        \"required_resource\": \"...\",\n        \"subject\": \"...\"\n    }\n}\nThese configuration options support variable expansion. Let's say you have the following match configuration:\n\"match\": {\n    \"url\": \"http://my-app/api/users//\",\n    \"methods\": [\"GET\"]\n},\nHere, you have two regular expressions,  and . You can reference the values matched by the\nregular expression with $1 and $2 (and more generally $n) and they will be substituted before making the request\nto ORY Keto:\n\"config\": {\n    \"required_action\": \"my:action:$1\",\n    \"required_resource\": \"my:resource:$2:foo:$1\"\n}\nAssuming a request to http://my-api/api/users/1234/foobar was made, the config from above would expand to:\n\"config\": {\n    \"required_action\": \"my:action:1234\",\n    \"required_resource\": \"my:resource:foobar:foo:1234\"\n}\nThe subject field configures what subject is passed on to keto warden.\nThe subject value is a string which will be parsed by the Go text/template\npackage for value substitution, receiving the AuthenticationSession\nstruct:\ntype AuthenticationSession struct {\n    Subject string\n    Extra   map[string]interface{}\n}\n\nIf subject is not specified it will default to AuthenticationSession.Subject.\nNote that the AuthenticationSession struct has a field named Extra which is a map[string]interface{}, which receives\nvarying introspection data from the authentication process. Because the contents of Extra are so variable, nested and\npotentially non-existent values need special handling by the text/template parser, and a print FuncMap function has\nbeen provided to ensure that non-existent map values will simply return an empty string, rather than .\nIf you find that your headers contain the string  then you have most likely omitted the print function, and\nit is recommended you use it for all values out of an abundance of caution and for consistency.\nExample\n{\n    \"id\": \"some-id\",\n    \"upstream\": {\n        \"url\": \"http://my-backend-service\"\n    },\n    \"match\": {\n        \"url\": \"http://my-app/api/users//\",\n        \"methods\": [\n            \"GET\"\n        ]\n    },\n    \"authenticators\": [/* ... */],\n    \"authorizer\": {\n        \"handler\": \"keto_warden\",\n        \"config\": {\n            \"required_action\": \"my:action:$1\",\n            \"required_resource\": \"my:resource:$2:foo:$1\"\n            \"subject\": \"{{ .Extra.email }}\"\n        }\n    }\n    /* ... */\n}\nCredentials Issuers\nA credentials issuer translates the credentials from incoming requests to credentials that you backend understands.\nFor example, the Authorization: basic header might be transformed to X-User: . This allows you to\nwrite backends that do not care if the original request was an anonymous one, an OAuth 2.0 Access Token, or some other\ncredential type. All your backend has to do is understand, for example, the X-User:.\nIf you access ORY Oathkeeper using the judge endpoint, the header will be included in the HTTP response.\nnoop\nThis credentials issuer does not transform the HTTP request and simply forwards the headers as-is. This is useful\nif you don't want to replace, for example, Authorization: basic with X-User: .\nExample\n{\n    \"id\": \"some-id\",\n    \"upstream\": {\n        \"url\": \"http://my-backend-service\"\n    },\n    \"match\": {\n        \"url\": \"http://my-app/api/users//\",\n        \"methods\": [\n            \"GET\"\n        ]\n    },\n    \"authenticators\": [/* ... */],\n    \"authorizer\": {/* ... */ }\n    \"credentials_issuer\" {\n        \"handler\": \"noop\"\n    }\n}\nid_token\nThis credentials issuer takes the authentication information (e.g. subject ID) and transforms it to a signed JSON Web Token,\nand more specifically to an OpenID Connect ID Token. You backend can verify the token by fetching the (public) key\nfrom the /.well-known/jwks.json endpoint.\nLet's say a request is made to a resource protected by ORY Oathkeeper:\nGET /api/resource HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.example.com\nAuthorization: bearer \nAssuming that ORY Oathkeeper is granting the access request, the  will be replaced with a\nJSON Web Token that is signed using the asymmetric RS256 key:\nGET /api/resource HTTP/1.1\nHost: internal-api-endpoint-dns\nAuthorization: bearer \nNow, the protected resource is capable of decoding and validating the JSON Web Token using the public key supplied\nby ORY Oathkeeper's API. The public key for decoding the ID token is available at Oathkeeper's /.well-known/jwks.json endpoint:\nhttp://oathkeeper:4456/.well-known/jwks.json\nThat .well-known/jwks.json endpoint is not served by the ORY Oathkeeper proxy process, but by\nthe ORY Oathkeeper API process. You will learn more about the difference between the two in the next chapters.\nThe related flow diagram looks like this:\n\nLet's say the oauth2_client_credentials authenticator successfully authenticated the credentials client-id:client-secret.\nThis credentials issuer will craft an ID Token (JWT) with the following exemplary claims:\n{\n  \"iss\": \"https://server.example.com\",\n  \"sub\": \"client-id\",\n  \"aud\": \"s6BhdRkqt3\",\n  \"jti\": \"n-0S6_WzA2Mj\",\n  \"exp\": 1311281970,\n  \"iat\": 1311280970,\n}\nThe ID Token Claims are as follows:\n\niss: Issuer Identifier for the Issuer of the response. The iss value is a case sensitive URL using the https scheme\n  that contains scheme, host, and optionally, port number and path components and no query or fragment components.\n  Typically, this is the URL of ORY Oathkeeper, for example: https://oathkeeper.myapi.com.\nsub: Subject Identifier. A locally unique and never reassigned identifier within the Issuer for the End-User, which\n  is intended to be consumed by the Client, e.g., 24400320 or AItOawmwtWwcT0k51BayewNvutrJUqsvl6qs7A4. It must not\n  exceed 255 ASCII characters in length. The sub value is a case sensitive string. The End-User might also\n  be an OAuth 2.0 Client, given that the access token was granted using the OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow.\naud: Audience(s) that this ID Token is intended for. It MUST contain the OAuth 2.0 client_id of the Relying Party\n  as an audience value. It MAY also contain identifiers for other audiences. In the general case, the aud value is an\n  array of case sensitive strings.\nexp: Expiration time on or after which the ID Token MUST NOT be accepted for processing. The processing of this\n  parameter requires that the current date/time MUST be before the expiration date/time listed in the value.\n  Its value is a JSON number representing the number of seconds from 1970-01-01T0:0:0Z as measured in UTC until the\n  date/time. See RFC 3339 [RFC3339] for details regarding date/times in general and UTC in particular.\niat: Time at which the JWT was issued. Its value is a JSON number representing the number of seconds\n  from 1970-01-01T0:0:0Z as measured in UTC until the date/time.\njti: A cryptographically strong random identifier to ensure the ID Token's uniqueness.\n\nThis credentials issuer implements several token signing algorithms, specifically:\n\nHS256: This algorithm uses a HMAC-SHA256 with a shared secret as opposed to private/public keys. This strategy\nis not encouraged for production.\nORY-HYDRA: This algorithm uses ORY Hydra's JWK management API to generate private/public RSA keypair. This strategy\nis encouraged for use in production.\n\nYou can set the strategy using the CREDENTIALS_ISSUER_ID_TOKEN_ALGORITHM environment variable. There also two more environment variables which modify\nthe behaviour of this strategy:\n\nCREDENTIALS_ISSUER_ID_TOKEN_LIFESPAN: The lifespan of the ID Token which defaults to 10 minutes. Example:\n  CREDENTIALS_ISSUER_ID_TOKEN_LIFESPAN=1s (1 second), CREDENTIALS_ISSUER_ID_TOKEN_LIFESPAN=1m (1 minute),\n  CREDENTIALS_ISSUER_ID_TOKEN_LIFESPAN=1h (1 hour), CREDENTIALS_ISSUER_ID_TOKEN_LIFESPAN=1d (1 day)\nCREDENTIALS_ISSUER_ID_TOKEN_ISSUER: Who issued the token - this will be the value of the iss claim in the\n  ID Token.\n\nToken Signing Algorithms\nHS256\nThe HS256 algorithm is the default one. This algorithm requires you to set the secret to be used for signing the ID Token.\nBe aware that anyone in possession of this secret - also anyone having access to the ./well-known/jwks.json URL\nwill be able to forge ID Tokens that will be accepted by your backends. We recommend using this strategy primarily\nfor development purposes.\nDo not use this strategy in production unless you know what you are doing. If you do use this in production, make sure\nthat noone (except the services validating the tokens) have access to the ./well-known/jwks.json URL.\nUse must use the CREDENTIALS_ISSUER_ID_TOKEN_HS256_SECRET environment variable to set the secret.\nORY-HYDRA\nThis ID Token signing algorithm uses ORY Hydra's JSON Web Key API to generate, store, and fetch a RSA public/private keypair.\nWhen using this algorithm, you have the following environment variables available:\n\nRequired\nCREDENTIALS_ISSUER_ID_TOKEN_HYDRA_ADMIN_URL: The URL where the ORY Hydra Admin API is located.\n\n\nOptional\nCREDENTIALS_ISSUER_ID_TOKEN_HYDRA_JWK_SET_ID: The ID to be used to create & fetch the JSON Web Key from ORY Hydra.\nDefaults to oathkeeper:id-token.\nCREDENTIALS_ISSUER_ID_TOKEN_JWK_REFRESH_INTERVAL: ORY Oathkeeper stores JSON Web Keys for ID Token signing in memory.\nThis value sets the refresh interval. Default is 5 minutes.\n\n\nIf this endpoint is protected using OAuth 2.0 Access Tokens, you can configure ORY Oathkeeper to authorize before\ncalling this endpoint. To do so, configure the following, optional settings:\nCREDENTIALS_ISSUER_ID_TOKEN_HYDRA_CLIENT_ID:  The ID of the OAuth 2.0 Client.\nCREDENTIALS_ISSUER_ID_TOKEN_HYDRA_CLIENT_SECRET: The secret of the OAuth 2.0 Client.\nCREDENTIALS_ISSUER_ID_TOKEN_HYDRA_CLIENT_SCOPES: The OAuth 2.0 Scope the client should request.\nCREDENTIALS_ISSUER_ID_TOKEN_HYDRA_PUBLIC_URL: The public URL where endpoint /oauth2/token is located.\n\n\n\nAccess Rule Configuration\nAdditionally, this credentials issuer allows you to specify the audience of the ID token per access rule. Setting\nthe audience is optional:\n\"credentials_issuer\": {\n    \"handler\": \"id_token\",\n    \"config\": {\n        \"aud\": [\"audience-1\", \"audience-2\"]\n    }\n}\nExample\n{\n    \"id\": \"some-id\",\n    \"upstream\": {\n        \"url\": \"http://my-backend-service\"\n    },\n    \"match\": {\n        \"url\": \"http://my-app/api/users//\",\n        \"methods\": [\n            \"GET\"\n        ]\n    },\n    \"authenticators\": [/* ... */],\n    \"authorizer\": {/* ... */ }\n    \"credentials_issuer\": {\n        \"handler\": \"id_token\",\n        \"config\": {\n            \"aud\": [\"audience-1\", \"audience-2\"]\n        }\n    }\n}\nheaders\nThis credentials issuer will transform the request, allowing you to pass the credentials to the upstream application via\nthe headers. This will augment, for example, Authorization: basic with X-User: .\nThe headers are specified via the headers field of the credentials issuer's config field. The keys are the header\nname and the values are a string which will be parsed by the Go text/template\npackage for value substitution, receiving the AuthenticationSession\nstruct:\ntype AuthenticationSession struct {\n    Subject string\n    Extra   map[string]interface{}\n}\n\nNote that the AuthenticationSession struct has a field named Extra which is a map[string]interface{}, which receives\nvarying introspection data from the authentication process. Because the contents of Extra are so variable, nested and\npotentially non-existent values need special handling by the text/template parser, and a print FuncMap function has\nbeen provided to ensure that non-existent map values will simply return an empty string, rather than .\nIf you find that your headers contain the string  then you have most likely omitted the print function, and\nit is recommended you use it for all values out of an abundance of caution and for consistency.\nExample\n{\n    \"id\": \"some-id\",\n    \"upstream\": {\n        \"url\": \"http://my-backend-service\"\n    },\n    \"match\": {\n        \"url\": \"http://my-app/api/\",\n        \"methods\": [\"GET\"]\n    },\n    \"authenticators\": [/* ... */],\n    \"authorizer\": {/* ... */}\n    \"credentials_issuer\" {\n        \"handler\": \"headers\",\n        \"config\": {\n            \"headers\": {\n                \"X-User\": \"{{ print .Subject }}\",\n                \"X-Some-Arbitrary-Data\": \"{{ print .Extra.some.arbitrary.data }}\"\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\ncookies\nThis credentials issuer will transform the request, allowing you to pass the credentials to the upstream application via\nthe cookies.\nThe cookies are specified via the cookies field of the credentials issuers config field. The keys are the cookie name\nand the values are a string which will be parsed by the Go text/template package\nfor value substitution, receiving the AuthenticationSession struct:\ntype AuthenticationSession struct {\n    Subject string\n    Extra   map[string]interface{}\n}\n\nNote that the AuthenticationSession struct has a field name Extra which is a map[string]interface{}, which receives\nvarying introspection data from the authentication process.

Scope foo matches foo but not foo.bar nor bar\nEXACT: Scope foo matches foo but not bar nor foo.bar\nNONE: Scope validation is disabled completely. It is expected that the upstream logic (e.g. OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection) handles scope validation\nproperly. If no upstream logic (e.g. JWT) exists, an error will be thrown if the scope is to be validated.\n\nRule Management\nRules REST API\nFor more information on available fields and exemplary payloads of rules, as well as rule management using HTTP\nplease refer to the REST API docs\nRules CLI API\nManagement of rules is not only possible through the REST API, but additionally using the ORY Oathkeeper CLI.\nFor help on how to manage the CLI, type oathkeeper help rules.\n"},"oathkeeper/1-overview/2-installation.html":{"url":"oathkeeper/1-overview/2-installation.html","title":"Installing ORY Oathkeeper","keywords":"","body":"Installing ORY Oathkeeper\n\n\n\nDocker Hub\nBinaries\nFrom Source\n\n\n\nYou can install ORY Oathkeeper by downloading the binaries, by using\nthe precompiled Docker Image available at Docker Hub, or by\ncompiling the code yourself.\nDocker Hub\nThe recommended way to install and run ORY Oathkeeper is via docker:\n$ docker run oryd/oathkeeper: help\n\nBinaries\nIf you download the binaries, make sure to add them to your path (e.g. /usr/bin).

Every app that\nhas users usually assigns permissions to these users (\"Bob, Alice are allowed to write blog posts\"). There are\nvarious established practices for assigning one or more permissions to one or more users.\nIn the context of access control, you'll often encounter identities or subjects as an alias for users. In this\ndocumentation we use the terminology subject as it summarizes users, robots, cronjobs, services, ... best. So\nwhenever you read \"subject\" you can substitute it with users, if it helps your understanding.\nLet's begin with a short overview of the established concepts surrounding permissions. Please be aware that the next\nsections are merely an overview of those topics and aimed at giving you some context. They do not explain all the\nnuances of each respective approach.\nAccess Control Lists (ACL)\nAn Access Control List (ACL) is a matrix of users and permissions:\n\n\n\n\nblog_post.create\nblog_post.delete\nblog_post.modify\nblog_post.read\n\n\n\n\nalice\nyes\nyes\nyes\nyes\n\n\nbob\nno\nno\nno\nyes\n\n\npeter\nyes\nno\nyes\nyes\n\n\n\nIn the example above, alice has the permission to create a blog post (blog_post.create) while bob des not. All three\n(alice, bob, peter) can read blog posts.\nSimilarly, you can create a matrix of resources (e.g. blog articles) and each user's permissions\n(c for create, m for modify, ...) with regards to that resource:\n\n\n\n\nblog_post.1\nblog_post.2\nblog_post.3\nblog_post.4\n\n\n\n\nalice\nc,r,m,d\nc,r,m,d\nc,r,m,d\nc,r,m,d\n\n\nbob\nr\nr\nr\nr\n\n\npeter\nc,r,m,d\nr\nc,r,m,d\nr\n\n\n\nACLs are common in filesystems (chmod / chown) and in applications with few subjects. However, the matrix becomes\nunreadable and unmanagable if you have thousands or even millions of subjects. Therefore, ACLs are rarely used in\nweb applications.\nRole Based Access Control (RBAC)\nRole Based Access Control (RBAC) maps subjects to roles\nand roles to permissions. The goal of RBAC is to make permission management convenient by grouping subjects\nin roles and assigning permissions roles. This type of access control is very common in web applications, where you often\nencounter roles such as \"administrator\", \"moderator\", and so on.\nWhat's common in RBAC is that roles can inherit permissions from one another. The role administrator, for example,\ncould inherit all permissions from role moderator. This further decreases management complexity as, instead of adding\nall permissions to administrator or assigning a user to both moderator and administrator roles, you simply point the\nadministrator role to inherit from the moderator one.\nLet's come back to alice, bob, peter, and blog posts and the matrix from the ACL example, but this time we define\nroles \"reader\", \"author\", \"admin\" and model the ACL example using RBAC:\n.\nAs you can see, admin inherits from author, which inherits from reader. Only alice (or rather admin) can delete blog posts,\nwhereas author can create and modify blog posts. We assign the roles to our subjects bob, peter, alice and\nexpress the same permissions as in the ACL example.\nRBAC is everywhere. If you ever installed a forum software such as phpBB,\nWordpress or others, you have definitely encountered ACL, RBAC, or both.\nRBAC reduces management complexity & overhead with large user/subject bases. Sometimes however, RBAC is not enough as well.\nThat's the case when you're trying to express ownership (e.g. bob can modify blog posts, but only his own), or\nhave attributes (e.g. bob works in department blog), or multi-tenant environments.\nAccess Control Policies (ACP)\nAccess Control Policies (usually JSON \"documents\") define an effect, subject, action, and resource. For example, alice (subject) is\nallowed (effect) to delete (action) blog article with ID my-first-blog-post (resource). This is very similar\nto how ACLs work:\n{\n    \"subjects\": [\"alice\"],\n    \"resources\": [\"blog_posts:my-first-blog-post\"],\n    \"actions\": [\"delete\"]\n    \"effect\": \"allow\"\n}\n\nThe policy above allows alice to delete blog_posts:my-first-blog-post. We could apply this policy to more subjects\nand also more actions or resources, if we want to:\n{\n    \"subjects\": [\"alice\", \"bob\"],\n    \"resources\": [\"blog_posts:my-first-blog-post\", \"blog_posts:2\", \"blog_posts:3\"],\n    \"actions\": [\"delete\", \"create\", \"read\", \"modify\"]\n    \"effect\": \"allow\"\n}\n\nWell, this looks like ACL in disguise so far. So what's different?\nPrecedence\nThe first difference is that we can explicitly deny access:\n{\n    \"subjects\": [\"peter\"],\n    \"resources\": [\"blog_posts:my-first-blog-post\", \"blog_posts:2\", \"blog_posts:3\"],\n    \"actions\": [\"delete\", \"create\", \"read\", \"modify\"]\n    \"effect\": \"deny\"\n}\n\nThe policy decision point (the one checking if something is allowed or not) applies the following rule set when deciding if something is allowed or not:\n\nIf at least one policy for a given subject, action, and resource matches, and the effect is deny, the request is always denied.\nIf no policy matches with effect deny, but at least one policy with effect allow, the request is allowed.\nIf no policy matches at all, the request is denied.\n\nPattern Matching with Regular Expressions\nORY Keto allows you to apply pattern matching with regular expressions as well. Depending on how you name your subjects,\nresources, and actions (for more on that topic go to the Best Practices section), you can apply\npattern matching using regular expressions.\n{\n    \"subjects\": [\"users:\"]\n}\n\nIn the example above, the (incomplete) policy would match every subject that is prefixed with users:, so for example\nusers:alice, users:bob. In ORY Ladon / ORY Keto, regular expressions are delimited with  and >.\nFor example, \"users:.*\" is not a valid regular expression, just a simple string.\nThe next example will allow all subjects with prefix user: to read (actions:read) all resources that match resources:blog_posts:\n(e.g. resources:blog_posts:1234 but not resources:blog_posts:abcde):\n{\n    \"subjects\": [\"users:\"],\n    \"resources\": [\"resources:blog_posts:\"],\n    \"actions\": [\"actions:read\"]\n    \"effect\": \"allow\"\n}\n\nConditions\nConditions are another powerful concept. So far, we covered that an Access Control Policies applies to a list of\nsubjects, resources, and actions. Conditions narrow down the use cases in which a certain ACP applies. A condition\nmay, for example, mandate that the IP Address of the client making the request has to match e.g. 192.168.0.0/16 or that\nthe subject is also the owner of the resource:\n{\n  \"description\": \"One policy to rule them all.\",\n  \"subjects\": [\"users:maria\"],\n  \"actions\" : [\"delete\", \"create\", \"update\"],\n  \"effect\": \"allow\",\n  \"resources\": [\"resources:articles:\"],\n  \"conditions\": {\n    \"remoteIPAddress\": {\n      \"type\": \"CIDRCondition\",\n      \"options\": {\n        \"cidr\": \"192.168.0.0/16\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nWhat conditions you can use and how you use is documented here. Since that requires knowledge of the Warden API\nworks, let's look at that first in the next chapter.\n"},"keto/1-overview/2-warden.html":{"url":"keto/1-overview/2-warden.html","title":"Access Control: The Warden API","keywords":"","body":"Access Control: The Warden API\n\n\n\nOverview\nAuthentication\nSubject Authenticator\nOAuth 2.0 Access Token Authenticator\nConfiguration\n\n\nOAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Authenticator\nConfiguration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview\nSo far you learned how Access Control Policies work and how they are different from RBAC and ACL. Now, you will learn\nhow to use the Warden API to perform access control (decide if a request should be allowed or not).\nBefore making a decision, we have to authenticate the subject. ORY Keto supports different authentication mechanisms\nexplained in the later sections. But first we'll look at how access requests work if we use \"plaintext\" authentication.\nLet's take a very simple policy:\n{\n    \"subjects\": [\"alice\"],\n    \"resources\": [\"blog_posts:my-first-blog-post\"],\n    \"actions\": [\"delete\"]\n    \"effect\": \"allow\"\n}\n\nBy the way, you can create this policy with the ORY Keto CLI:\n# We assume that your keto server runs at http://your-keto-server\n$ keto policies create --endpoint http://your-keto-server \\\n    -a delete \\\n    -s alice \\\n    -r \"blog_posts:my-first-blog-post\"\n    --allow\nOk, so let's say a request hits our blog post API. The subject (user) that made the request is bob and bob wants\nto delete the blog post blog_posts:my-first-blog-post. You will make a REST request to ORY Keto's Warden API:\n$ curl -X POST http://your-keto-server/warden/subjects/authorize \\\n    --header \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n    -d @- In this case, the response would be { \"allowed\": false } because no policy matching bob, delete,\nblog_posts:my-first-blog-post was found. If we were to make the same Warden API requests with alice\n# curl -X POST http://your-keto-server/warden/subjects/authorize \\\n    --header \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n    -d @- the response would be true because a policy was found and the effect was allow: { \"allowed\": true }. You can\nuse the ORY Keto CLI to make the same request:\n$ keto warden authorize subject --endpoint http://your-keto-server \\\n    --action delete \\\n    --resource \"blog_posts:my-first-blog-post\" \\\n    --subject alice\nAuthentication\nORY Keto supports different authentication methods at the Warden API. So far, we used the subject authenticator\nwhich does not authenticate at all but simply takes the value of subject key in the request body. Currently supported\nauthenticators are:\n\n/warden/subjects/authorize: The subject (\"plaintext\") authenticator we already used.\n/warden/oauth2/access-tokens/authorize: Validates OAuth 2.0 Access Token using the OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection\nstandard to resolve Access Tokens to subjects.\n/warden/oauth2/clients/authorize: Validates OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials using the OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials\nGrant to authenticate OAuth 2.0 Clients.\n\nWe intend on adding more authenticators such as JSON Web Tokens, SAML Assertions, and others in time.\nLet's take a deeper look at all of the available authenticators\nSubject Authenticator\nYou know this one already. The endpoint is located at /warden/subjects/authorize and you use request bodies such\nas:\n{\n  \"subject\": \"alice\",\n  \"action\" : \"delete\",\n  \"resource\": \"blog_posts:my-first-blog-post\"\n}\nThe subject key is used as subject when looking for policies. No magic here, it's like authenticating with just\na username.\nOAuth 2.0 Access Token Authenticator\nThis authenticator is located at /warden/oauth2/access-tokens/authorize and is able to validate OAuth 2.0 Access Tokens\nusing the OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection standard. Instead of supplying a subject, you add an OAuth 2.0 Token and\noptionally the OAuth 2.0 Scope to the request payload:\n{\n  \"token\": \"some.access.token.57jgoi19g\",\n  \"scope\": [\"scope-a\", \"scope-b\"],\n\n  \"action\" : \"delete\",\n  \"resource\": \"blog_posts:my-first-blog-post\"\n}\nLet's assume for a second, that the token some.access.token.57jgoi19g was granted by subject alice with OAuth 2.0 Scope\nscope-a and scope-b. In this case, the OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection endpoint would return a positive response (the token\nis valid) and also the subject alice. So this authenticator looks for a policy that matches:\n{\n  \"subject\": \"alice\",\n  \"action\" : \"delete\",\n  \"resource\": \"blog_posts:my-first-blog-post\"\n}\nConfiguration\nYou can configure this authenticator using the following environment variables:\n\nAUTHENTICATOR_OAUTH2_INTROSPECTION_URL: The URL of the OAuth 2.0 Introspection Endpoint (usually /oauth2/introspection).\nAUTHENTICATOR_OAUTH2_INTROSPECTION_SCOPE_STRATEGY: Since you can include a scope in the request body, ORY Keto\nallows you to configure a OAuth 2.0 strategy that defines how to compare OAuth 2.0 Scope:\nhierarchic: Scope foo matches foo, foo.bar, foo.baz but not bar\nwildcard: Scope foo.* matches foo, foo.bar, foo.baz but not bar. Scope foo matches foo but not foo.bar nor bar\nexact: Scope foo matches foo but not bar nor foo.bar\n\n\nIn cases where the OAuth 2.0 Introspection endpoint is protected using OAuth 2.0 Access Tokens, you can configure ORY Keto to\nauthorize before calling this endpoint with the following configuration:\nAUTHENTICATOR_OAUTH2_INTROSPECTION_CLIENT_ID: The OAuth 2.0 Client ID that should be used to make the OAuth 2.0\nIntrospection request.\nAUTHENTICATOR_OAUTH2_INTROSPECTION_CLIENT_SECRET: The OAuth 2.0 Client Secret that should be used to make the OAuth 2.0\nIntrospection request.\nAUTHENTICATOR_OAUTH2_INTROSPECTION_TOKEN_URL: The URL of the OAuth 2.0 Token Endpoint (usually /oauth2/token).\nAUTHENTICATOR_OAUTH2_INTROSPECTION_SCOPE: If an OAuth 2.0 Scope is required to access the introspection URL, add that here.\nYou can define a list using the comma delimiter: AUTHENTICATOR_OAUTH2_INTROSPECTION_SCOPE=scope-a,scope-b.\n\n\n\nOAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Authenticator\nThis authenticator is located at /warden/oauth2/clients/authorize and is able to authenticate OAuth 2.0 Clients\nusing the OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials grant. A request payload looks as follows:\n{\n  \"client_id\": \"client-id\",\n  \"client_secret\": \"client-secret\",\n  \"scope\": [\"scope-a\", \"scope-b\"],\n\n  \"action\" : \"delete\",\n  \"resource\": \"blog_posts:my-first-blog-post\"\n}\nIf the OAuth 2.0 Token endpoint returns an access token, the OAuth 2.0 Clients is considered authenticated. The OAuth 2.0\nClient ID is used as subject when querying for ACPs:\n{\n  \"subject\": \"client-id\",\n  \"action\" : \"delete\",\n  \"resource\": \"blog_posts:my-first-blog-post\"\n}\nConfiguration\nThis endpoint needs only one environment variable:\n\nAUTHENTICATOR_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CREDENTIALS_TOKEN_URL: The URL of the OAuth 2.0 Token Endpoint (usually /oauth2/token).\n\n"},"keto/1-overview/3-roles.html":{"url":"keto/1-overview/3-roles.html","title":"Roles","keywords":"","body":"Roles\nORY Keto supports the concept of roles (like in RBAC). This feature allows you to group together a number of subjects\nunder the same role. Whenever making a request to the Warden API, it will check the role's of a subject (if there are any)\nand use them when looking up Access Control Policies.\nAssuming the following policies:\n{\n    \"subjects\": [\"bob\"],\n    \"resources\": [\"blog_posts:my-first-blog-post\"],\n    \"actions\": [\"create\"]\n    \"effect\": \"allow\"\n}\n\n{\n    \"subjects\": [\"admin\"],\n    \"resources\": [\"blog_posts:my-first-blog-post\"],\n    \"actions\": [\"delete\"]\n    \"effect\": \"allow\"\n}\n\nAs you can see, bob is allowed to create resource blog_posts:my-first-blog-post and admin is allowed to delete it.\nWarden request\n{\n  \"subject\": \"bob\",\n  \"action\" : \"delete\",\n  \"resource\": \"blog_posts:my-first-blog-post\"\n}\nwill return { \"allowed\": false } while Warden request\n{\n  \"subject\": \"admin\",\n  \"action\" : \"delete\",\n  \"resource\": \"blog_posts:my-first-blog-post\"\n}\nwill return { \"allowed\": true }.

ORY Keto uses conditions defined in ORY Ladon.\nAdding new condition handlers must be done through creating a pull request in the ORY Ladon repository.\nA condition has always the same JSON format:\n{\n  \"subjects\": [\"...\"],\n  \"actions\" : [\"...\"],\n  \"effect\": \"allow\",\n  \"resources\": [\"...\"],\n  \"conditions\": {\n    \"this-key-will-be-matched-with-the-context\": {\n      \"type\": \"SomeConditionType\",\n      \"options\": {\n        \"some\": \"configuration options set by the condition type\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nThe context in the access request made to ORY Keto's Warden API must match the specified key in the condition\nin order to be evaluated by the condition logic:\n{\n  \"subject\": \"...\",\n  \"action\" : \"...\",\n  \"resource\": \"...\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"this-key-will-be-matched-with-the-context\": { \"foo\": \"bar\" }\n  }\n}\n\nCIDR Condition\nThe CIDR condition matches CIDR IP Ranges. An exemplary policy definition could look as follows.\n{\n  \"description\": \"One policy to rule them all.\",\n  \"subjects\": [\"users:maria\"],\n  \"actions\" : [\"delete\", \"create\", \"update\"],\n  \"effect\": \"allow\",\n  \"resources\": [\"resources:articles:\"],\n  \"conditions\": {\n    \"remoteIPAddress\": {\n      \"type\": \"CIDRCondition\",\n      \"options\": {\n

\"resources:articles:12345\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"remoteIPAddress\": \"192.168.0.5\"\n  }\n}\n\nThe next access request would be denied as the condition is not fulfilled and thus no policy is matched.\n{\n  \"subject\": \"users:maria\",\n  \"action\" : \"delete\",\n  \"resource\": \"resources:articles:12345\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"remoteIPAddress\": \"255.255.0.0\"\n  }\n}\n\nThe next access request would also be denied as the context is not using the key remoteIPAddress but instead someOtherKey.\n{\n  \"subject\": \"users:maria\",\n  \"action\" : \"delete\",\n  \"resource\": \"resources:articles:12345\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"someOtherKey\": \"192.168.0.5\"\n  }\n}\n\nString Equal Condition\nChecks if the value passed in the access request's context is identical with the string that was given initially.\n{\n  \"description\": \"One policy to rule them all.\",\n  \"subjects\": [\"users:maria\"],\n  \"actions\" : [\"delete\", \"create\", \"update\"],\n  \"effect\":

\"action\" : \"delete\",\n  \"resource\": \"resources:articles:12345\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"someKeyName\": \"this-is-a-different-value\"\n  }\n}\n\nString Match Condition\nChecks if the value passed in the access request's context matches the regular expression that was given initially.\n{\n  \"description\": \"One policy to rule them all.\",\n  \"subjects\": [\"users:maria\"],\n  \"actions\" : [\"delete\", \"create\", \"update\"],\n  \"effect\": \"allow\",\n  \"resources\": [\"resources:articles:\"],\n  \"conditions\": {\n    \"someKeyName\": {\n      \"type\":

\"users:maria\",\n  \"action\" : \"delete\",\n  \"resource\": \"resources:articles:12345\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"someKeyName\": \"regex-pattern-here-matches\"\n  }\n}\n\nThe following access request would be denied.\n{\n  \"subject\": \"users:maria\",\n  \"action\" : \"delete\",\n  \"resource\": \"resources:articles:12345\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"someKeyName\": \"regex-pattern-here\"\n  }\n}\n\nSubject Condition\nChecks if the access request's subject is identical with the string specified in the context.\n{\n  \"description\": \"One policy to rule them all.\",\n  \"subjects\": [\"users:maria\"],\n  \"actions\" : [\"delete\", \"create\", \"update\"],\n  \"effect\": \"allow\",\n  \"resources\": [\"resources:articles:\"],\n  \"conditions\": {\n    \"owner\": {\n      \"type\":

\"resources:articles:12345\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"owner\": \"users:maria\"\n  }\n}\n\nThe following access request would be denied.\n{\n  \"subject\": \"users:maria\",\n  \"action\" : \"delete\",\n  \"resource\": \"resources:articles:12345\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"owner\": \"another-user\"\n  }\n}\n\nThis condition makes more sense when being used with access tokens where the subject is extracted from the token.\nString Pairs Equal Condition\nChecks if the value passed in the access request's context contains two-element arrays and that both elements in each pair are equal.\n{\n  \"description\": \"One policy to rule them all.\",\n  \"subjects\": [\"users:maria\"],\n  \"actions\" : [\"delete\", \"create\", \"update\"],\n  \"effect\": \"allow\",\n  \"resources\":

This means that any request\nmade to e.g. /policies or /warden/... is considered authenticated and thus executed. However, these endpoints\nare very sensitive as they define who is allowed to do what in your system.\nPlease use an API Gateway or a similar mechanism to protect these endpoints. How you protect them, is up to you.\nIf you require dedicated help with this, consider asking us for consultancy.\n"},"performance/":{"url":"performance/","title":"Performance Benchmarks","keywords":"","body":"Performance Benchmarks\nOur ecosystem is not another over-hyped, oversold technology stack.

The identifier\nis a Universally Unique Identifier (V4) and is thus a cryptographically safe random string. Identification is triggered\nwhen we are confident that the instance is not a test instance (e.g. one of the tutorials or a local installation).\nWe collect the following system metrics:\n\ngoarch: The target architecture of the ORY Hydra binary.\ngoos: The target system of the ORY Hydra binary.\nnumCpu: The number of CPUs available.\nruntimeVersion: The go version used to create the binary.\nversion: The version of this binary.\nhash: The git hash of this binary.\nbuildTime: The build time of this binary.\n\nRequest telemetry\nThe ip addresses of both host and client are anonymized to 0.0.0.0. Any identifiable information in the URL path and query is hashed with\nsha256 using a randomly assigned uuid v4 salt:\n\n/clients/foo with salt ABCDEFGH becomes /clients/sha256(\"foo|ABCDEFGH\"): /clients/0301424a80469ad03a208de925563a97ec6ab2f9dc7a2ad71b2ded85a7f7a7af\n/policies?owner=foo with salt ABCDEFGH becomes /policies?owner=sha256(\"foo|ABCDEFGH\"): /policies?owner=0301424a80469ad03a208de925563a97ec6ab2f9dc7a2ad71b2ded85a7f7a7af).\n\nCode\nThe full code-base is open sourced.\nData processing\nOnce the data was transmitted to Segment.com it is aggregated and then fed to an encrypted AWS S3 bucket.\nWe analyze the data with the following goals:\n\nBe able to say how many production deployments exist.\nUnderstand which features are used and how.\nUnderstand how much throughput deployments handle.\nEvaluate how frequently specific features (e.g. policies) are used.\nDetect issues introduced by new features (e.g. buggy releases). For example:\nAfter release 0.X.Y, all instances show 25% increase in response times for Warden API calls.\n\n\nIdentify real-world problems caused by things such as slow queries. For example:\nSearching for policies by owners takes causes high response times.\nRunning the deployment for several months and high traffic causes slow response times.\n\n\n\nDisabling telemetry\nYou can opt out of telemetry reports with the --disable-telemetry flag and also by\nsetting environment variable DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1.\nDisabling telemetry does not have any downsides, except for us not being able to improve the product.\n"}}}
